<h2>LADY DOCTORS
IN HEATHEN LANDS</h2>

<p class="center">By the Author of "The Child Wives and Widows of India," Etc.</p>


<div class="drop">
 <img src="images/img106b.jpg" alt="A" width="100" height="104" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">A garrison of snow-capped
mountains;
a valley smiling in
Oriental luxuriance;
the gorgeous,
romantic loveliness
described in "Lalla
Rookh"&mdash;such are
the general impressions
of the land
of Kashmir. Dirt, disease, and degradation
summed up its prevailing characteristics
in the eyes of an Englishman, who,
in October, 1872, toiled wearily over the
Pir Panjal, 11,900 feet above the level of
the sea.</p>
</div>

<p>This was Dr. Elmslie's last journey. He
hardly realised, as he dragged his weary
limbs over rough but familiar paths, that
one object for which he had struggled for
years was practically accomplished. He
sank from exhaustion on the way, and the
day after his death Government granted
permission for missionaries to spend the
winter in the Valley of Kashmir. Still
farther was he from knowing of another
result of his labours. He had appealed to
Englishwomen to bring the gifts of healing
to suffering and secluded inmates of
zenanas. Dr. Elmslie had found a direct
way to the hearts of prejudiced heathen
men. The sick came to him for healing,
and learnt the meaning of his self-denying
life.</p>

<p class="center">THE LATE DR. FANNY BUTLER.</p>

<p class="center">(<em>At the time she went to India.</em>)</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Skin for skin, yea, all that a man
hath will he give for his life," are ancient
words of wisdom; but this rule has exceptions.
To Hindu women, at least, caste is
dearer than life. It would be as easy to
restore the down to a bruised butterfly's
wing as to give back self-respect, and with
it all that makes life worth living, to a
zenana lady who has been exposed to the
gaze or touch of a man other than a near
relation. Custom of the country debars a
respectable woman from receiving ministry
to body, soul, or mind, unless it comes from
one of her own sex. Dr. Elmslie's appeal
resulted in Miss Fanny Butler's offer of
service to the Indian Female Normal
School and Instruction Society. She was
the first enrolled student of the London
School of Medicine, which had just been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
transferred from Edinburgh, and passed
second out of one hundred and twenty-three
candidates, one hundred and nineteen
of whom were men, in the Preliminary
Arts Examination. She went to India
in October, 1880, the first fully qualified
medical missionary to women.</p>

<p>Seventeen years after Dr. Elmslie's
death Dr. Fanny Butler obtained another
concession for Kashmir, the permission for
missionaries to live within the city of
Srinagar. She saw the foundations of a
new hospital for women begun within the
city, and fourteen days after she also
laid down what, an hour before her death,
she described as a "good long life," in the
service of Kashmiri people. The age of
thirty-nine, she said to the friends who
surrounded her, and who felt that she
of all others could not be spared, was
"not so very young to die," and she
sent an earnest plea to the Church of
England Zenana Society, the division of
the old society to which she belonged,
to send someone quickly to take her
place. The new hospital was the gift of
Mrs. Bishop (Miss Isabella Bird) in memory
of her husband. She had seen the dirty
crowd of suffering women at the dispensary
door overpower two men, and
the earliest arrivals precipitated head
foremost by the rush from behind, whilst
numbers were turned away in misery
and disappointment.</p>

<p>Hospitals and dispensaries have rapidly
increased since the day of pioneers. Absolute
necessity has forced medical work
on many missionaries in the field. The
most elementary knowledge of nursing
and hygiene appears miraculous to women
sunk in utter ignorance. A white woman
too modest to give them remedies for every
ailment is usually regarded as unkind.
A neglected missionary dispensary is
practically unknown.</p>

<p class="center">(<em>Showing some of the patients placed out to spend the hot night in the open.</em>)</p></div>
</div>

<p>At the time when the Countess Dufferin
started her admirable scheme for providing
medical aid for Indian women a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
well-known Anglo-Indian surgeon stated
publicly that, whatever other qualification
was required in a candidate, two were
absolutely necessary: she must be a lady
in the highest sense of the word, and
she must be a Christian, and he proceeded
to give good reasons for what
he said. The experience of every woman
who has taken up this work would bear
out his sentiments. Without courtesy
and ready intuition of the feelings of
others it would be hard to get an entrance
into zenanas, and nothing but
love and devotion to her Master would
enable a woman to persevere in spending
her life amongst sick heathen women, in
spite of sights, scenes, and vexations
beyond conception in England.</p>

<p class="center">THE DUCHESS OF CONNAUGHT'S HOSPITAL, PESHAWUR.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The greatest difficulties are probably
met in high-caste zenanas. There, in the
midst of unhealthy surroundings, the
friends and neighbours have grand opportunities
of undoing any good that may
have been accomplished. It is grievous
to a medical missionary to find her fever
patient dying from a douche of cold water,
because the white woman has defiled her
high caste by feeling her pulse. It is
enough to make her give up a case in
despair if, after she has explained that
quiet is absolutely necessary, the friends
and neighbours decide that the evil spirit
supposed to be in possession must be driven
out by the music of tom-toms. A Hindu man
is said to "sin religiously," and a Hindu
woman excels him in devotion to her
creed. A fever patient in the Punjab
refused to drink milk&mdash;the one thing of all
others that her medical woman ordered
her&mdash;because she said, if it were the last
thing she swallowed, her soul would pass
into the body of a cobra. One medical
missionary found a woman, who was in
a critical state, lying on a mat, whilst
an old woman, supposed to be learned
in sickness, stood on her body, or patrolled
up and down like a sentinel, as far as
the length would admit. This was kindly
meant. Another found one suffering
seriously from the effect of a linseed
poultice. She had carefully explained
the mysteries of making and applying
it, but in her absence the patient's
friends had spread dry linseed over her
chest and poured boiling water over it.</p>

<p class="center">WAITING THEIR TURN.</p>

<p class="center">(<em>Patients outside the Tarn Taran Hospital Dispensary.</em>)</p></div>
</div>

<p>Happily, all the women in India are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">&nbsp;</a><br /><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
not secluded in zenanas. By far the
largest proportion live in the villages,
but their notions of propriety are very
strict. The hard-working field-women
will hide themselves on the suspicion
of a <em>sahib</em> being within reach. When
once they are satisfied that the visitor
belongs to their own sex and is harmless,
crowds beset the missionary encampments.
Many tales of suffering are
poured into sympathising ears.</p>

<p>"I am blind from crying for my only
son" is not an infrequent complaint.
Nothing can be done in this case.</p>

<p>"There is no god or goddess to love
a Hindu woman. Whatever offerings we
make her, the goddess of small-pox smites
us, and then the men say the women have
not offered enough, and are angry."
This was the reply of a Punjabi woman,
who spoke for her friends and neighbours.</p>

<p>One Bengali woman told a missionary
of the death of a precious baby boy.
There did not seem much the matter, but
the <em>hakim</em> (a native quack) first gave
him something burning to swallow,
and then applied a red-hot iron to each
side in turn; and the child only drew
one or two breaths after this treatment.
This also, one hopes, was kindly meant.
The Hindus are by no means wanting
in humanity, but ignorance is often as
fatal as cruelty.</p>

<p>Many patients find an excuse for coming
again and again to the dispensaries.
There they hear of blessings in this
world and the next which they say
seem too good to be true. They see
love shining in the earnest faces, and
feel it in the touch of hands that will
not shrink from dressing repulsive sores.</p>

<p>The majority of cases in dispensaries
are ordinary fevers or skin diseases resulting
from dirt, and other scourges
that follow defiance of elementary rules
of health.</p>

<p>Patients discharged as cured often return.
"Tell me again that Name that I
can say when I pray," one of them
asked, to explain the reappearance of
her shrivelled old face; "I forget so
soon." And she went on her way repeating
the Name that even some of the
heathen realise must be exalted above
all others.</p>

<p>"I know that your Jesus must reign
over our land," a Punjabi woman said
to a lady who had opened a dispensary
at Tarn Taran, a sacred city of the Sikhs;
"I know it, because your religion is full
of love and ours has none at all."</p>

<p>The mission hospital at this city, with
the name which literally means "The Place
of Salvation," and the dispensary seen in
the illustration, came mainly into being
through the determination of the inhabitants.
A suffering baby might claim a
share in its existence. This infant's
mother brought it to a missionary whose
training as a nurse had made her a
friend in sickness. The child's sight was
hopelessly gone. The mother said that
the <em>hakim</em> had told her alum was good
for sore eyes, so she had put it under
the lids.</p>

<p>"You have used it in such a way as
to blind your baby," the missionary said;
"and I could have told you what to do."</p>

<p>"How should I know?" the woman replied,
using a common phrase to express
helplessness or lethargy; but she told the
story to her friends, and other mothers,
whose babies' eyes were suffering, soon
proved that the white woman had made
no empty boast. Ophthalmia is terribly
common in India, and its marvellous
cures began to be famous.</p>

<p>One day a family party carried an invalid
into the verandah of the Tarn Taran mission
house. The missionary looked inside
the <em>doolie</em>; she was not a doctor, and
declined to undertake such a serious
case, and told the men to take their
invalid to the Amritsar Hospital. They
were determined to take no such trouble.
To show that she was equally determined
to make them, she went inside the house
and shut the doors and blinds. Who
would hold out the longest? The result
was a foregone conclusion. The Punjabis,
armed with a greater disregard for a
woman's life, gained the victory by the
simple method of beating a retreat,
leaving the helpless woman behind them.
In common humanity she could not be
left to die. In a few days her family
returned to inquire, and were gratified
to find her progressing towards recovery.
The white woman's celebrity was now
secured, and to her consternation and
embarrassment she found her verandah
full of patients, and, from overwork, was
soon herself added to the number. The
people of Tarn Taran afterwards gave the
building for a Women's Mission Hospital,
and a new one is now in the charge of
a fully qualified lady doctor.</p>

<p>Hospitals are by far the most satisfactory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
part of medical missions. In zenanas
and dispensaries it is one thing to prescribe
and give advice, and another for
orders to be obeyed, especially if they
are contrary to rules of caste or custom.
It is well known that a Hindu soldier,
who will follow his British officer into the
fiercest <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mêlée</i>, and, if necessary, die for
him, if true to his own creed, will not
receive a cup of water at his hands.
When wounded his parched lips will close
tightly, lest his caste should suffer. The
same principle debars his womenfolk
from accepting physic in a liquid form
from Englishwomen. They may, however,
take powders. Written directions are
generally useless, and verbal ones often
misunderstood. It is little wonder if dispensary
patients make slow progress.</p>

<p>"Are you sure you took the medicine I
gave you?" inquired a medical missionary
of one who made no advance at all.</p>

<p>"Quite sure, Miss Sahiba."</p>

<p>"How did you take it?"</p>

<p>"I ate the paper and threw away the
dust."</p>

<p>This mistake was not astonishing under
the circumstances. One Mohammedan
specific is to swallow a paper pellet with
the name of God written in Arabic;
another, for the <em>mullah</em> to write an Arabic
inscription on a plate, and for the water
that washes it off to be the dose.</p>

<p class="center">(<em>Dr. Wheeler stands at the left-hand side of group.</em>)</p></div>
</div>

<p>It is well when superstition and misconception
stop short at swallowing
paper and inky water. A woman,
seriously injured from an accident, was
carried into the Duchess of Connaught
Hospital, Peshawur. Her husband accompanied
her, and saw the medical
missionary in charge carefully attend
to fractures and bruises. Rest and
sleep and quiet were doing their work,
and the man was left to watch. A
sudden crash startled the ward. The
husband had turned the bedstead over
on its side, and flung his wife down. He
fancied she was dying, and said it would
imperil her soul if it departed whilst she
lay on anything but the floor. He had
the satisfaction of knowing that she died
where he placed her. This was a case of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
a Hindu "sinning religiously." It would
be harder to forgive the frequent sacrifice
of life to superstition, if there were no
ennobling element underlying it of honest
desire for some vague spiritual good.</p>

<p>The Duchess of Connaught Hospital is
a permanent memorial of her Royal
Highness's kind interest in the women of
India. Whilst on the North-Western
Frontier she went through the Dispensary
and Nursing Home which represented the
first effort to bring medical aid to the
Afghan women, and allowed it to be
called after her name. A new and much
larger building, of which a drawing has
been reproduced, has taken the place of
the native quarters, where Mohammedan
bigotry was by slow degrees overcome.
For years the ladies of the Church of
England Zenana Missionary Society, who
had charge of this hospital, were the
only Europeans living within the walls
of Peshawur. Every night the great
city gates closed them in, and separated
them from other missionaries and from
Government servants. They chose to be
in the midst of their work, and though
outbreaks of Mohammedan fanaticism
repeatedly checked teaching in schools and
zenanas, ministry to the sick continued,
and never lost the friendly confidence of
Peshawuris.</p>

<p class="center">STAFF AND PATIENTS OF ST. CATHERINE'S HOSPITAL, AMRITSAR.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In its early and humbler days, the fame
of this hospital reached far-away Khorassan.
A lady of that country who was
suffering terribly, caused herself to be
carried the fifteen days' journey to Peshawur.
Miss Mitcheson, who opened the first
dispensary, and is now the head of the
hospital, saw that her case was critical
and required an operation of a far more
serious kind than she had ever attempted,
and begged her to allow the civil surgeon
to see her.</p>

<p>"I would rather die," the patient answered.
The combined forces of suffering,
fear of death, and persuasion, were powerless
to move her. The Englishwoman, of
whose powers she had heard in her own
country, might do what she liked with
her, but no man should come near her.
Happily Miss Mitcheson successfully accomplished
what was necessary, and the
Khorassan lady made a good recovery.
When the time came for parting from her
new friends, she promised to use in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
own country the knowledge she had
gained in Peshawur. She kept her word,
as more visitors from Khorassan testified,
and they said she had not forgotten the
benefits she had received in the mission
hospital.</p>

<p class="center">BACK VIEW OF NEW WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,

</div>

<p>During Miss Mitcheson's absence in
England Dr. Charlotte Wheeler, who
with her fellow-workers, in the illustration
on p. 102, stands in the
verandah of the old building, superintended
the medical work. On Miss
Mitcheson's return, Miss Wheeler opened
a medical mission amongst the women
in Quetta. This work extended rapidly
on and beyond the frontier, so that in
November, 1896, when it was a year old,
eight different languages were spoken
on the same day in the dispensary waiting
room.</p>

<p>Institutions for training Christian girls
of India as doctors or nurses have come
into existence as the number of candidates
has increased and the necessity has arisen.
The North India School of Medicine has
been established at Ludhiana with this
object. Many of the mission hospitals
also have training classes. St. Catherine's
Hospital, Amritsar, under the superintendence
of Miss Hewlett, who has had
nineteen years' experience, has provided
very valuable assistant medical missionaries
for stations in the Punjab and Bengal.
At the last census a hundred Christian
women&mdash;counting missionaries, assistants,
patients, nurses and students&mdash;were within
its walls. An illustration shows the inmates
mustering before going to church.</p>

<p>One student in St. Catherine's Hospital,
who had gained a scholarship, gave promise
of a brilliant career. Before the time
of study in which she delighted was over,
the lady superintendent became suspicious
of what this young girl described as
broken chilblains on her fingers. A doctor
was called in, and confirmed her impression
that it was leprosy. An Eastern girl
knows, what in Europe is only faintly
imagined, of the horrors of this loathsome
disease. One cry of anguish only escaped
her when she was told the verdict. Then
she rose above the trial, and resigned
herself cheerfully to the will of God. She
was prepared to start the next day for
the Leper Settlement near Calcutta without
meeting her friends or fellow-students
for a word of farewell.</p>

<p>"What comforts me," she said to the
Clerical Secretary of the Church of
England Zenana Missionary Society, who
was in Amritsar at the time, "is that I
may go as a missionary rather than as a
patient."</p>

<p>She went to that place of death and
banishment, to live out the rest of her
days in ministry for others. In her case
the days lingered into years, and the
disease took a severe form, but her devotion
and courage never failed. When
death came to her as a friend, and her
work was done, the memory of the
"superior girl," who had lived among
the afflicted people as a missionary rather
than a patient, remained. Perhaps her
fellowship in suffering gave her the final
qualification to be a missionary to lepers.</p>

<p>India is the land which above all others
cries out for lady medical missionaries;
but other Eastern countries have also a
claim. Wherever Islam has planted its
iron heel, women are jealously guarded in
harems, and it is very unusual for a man
to be allowed entrance on any pretext.
In China, also, women of superior class
are hidden within the high walls that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
surround their houses. Those free to go
out gain little but suffering from the
barbarous attentions of native surgeons.
In the East the knowledge which brings
relief from pain is a power to overcome
obstacles to Christianity that resist
every other force.</p>

<p>The Church of England Zenana Missionary
Society has sent out a qualified lady
doctor to Foochow, and in 1894 the Church
Missionary Society opened a hospital for
women in Hangchow with one large and
six smaller wards. One patient who was
brought into this building&mdash;of which
two views are given&mdash;suffering from
diseased bones, has gone out to devote
her recovered health and new knowledge
to the service of God and her own
countrywomen.</p>

<p>There is scarcely a mission hospital or
dispensary that cannot tell of similar
results of the double ministry to body
and soul. Each year justifies the increased
number of women with medical
qualifications sent into the mission field.
Some, like Mrs. Russell Watson, of the
Baptist Mission at Chefu, are the wives
of missionaries, others have been sent
out by various missions, such as the
Zenana Bible and Medical Mission, or
by the women's branches (added during
the close of the present century), to the
more venerable societies.</p>

<p>Dr. Henry Martyn Clark, of Amritsar,
once asked a friendly Hindu what department
of foreign missions his people
considered most dangerous.</p>

<p>"Why should I reveal our secrets to the
enemy?" the Hindu responded. But he
yielded to persuasion. "We do not very
much fear your preaching," he said, "for
we need not listen; nor your schools,
for we need not send our children; nor
your books, for we need not read them.
But we do fear your women, for they
are gaining our homes; and we very much
fear your medical missions, for they are
gaining our hearts. Hearts and homes
gone, what shall we have left?"</p>

<p>What may be expected when medical
and women's missions are combined?
According to the friendly Hindu, the
very citadels of idolatry and superstition
might tremble at the advance of this
double force to rescue the captives.</p>

<p>This month we devote our space to a pictorial representation of an heroic act by James Williamson, a fisherman
of Whalsay, Shetland. During a heavy storm he waded out to the succour of two companions,
who had been pinned on the rocks by their capsized boat and were in imminent danger of drowning.
Williamson was at first carried away by a heavy sea, but was returned by the next. Then with an
extraordinary effort he lifted the side of the boat, seized the men, and, with one under each arm, fought his
way through the boiling surf to dry land. For this conspicuous act of bravery Williamson was awarded the
Silver Medal of <span class="smcap">The Quiver</span> Heroes Fund.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>YOUTH AT THE PROW.</h3>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/img116b.jpg" alt="A" width="100" height="120" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_1">"And then, old fellow,"
went on Sir
Anthony's letter
to Jack Leslie,
of the Blues, his
particular chum,
"I stood staring,
with my eyes
watering and a
little scratch on
my nose bleeding
where the old
rooster&mdash;for a
rooster it was&mdash;struck
me with his spurs as he flew. He
might have knocked out my eye, the brute!
The second missile (an invention they
call a sun-bonnet, I believe, made of pink
calico and horribly stiffened) lay crumpled
at my feet. And there in front of me
stood the culprit herself, looking half-ashamed
and half-inclined to follow the
example of the other sun-bonnet which had
buried itself in a big chair at the end of
the room, and made scarcely a pretence of
stifling its peals of laughter. I felt no end
of a ninny I can tell you, especially as the
owner of the first sun-bonnet was by long
chalks the most beautiful creature I'd ever
seen.</p>
</div>

<p>"I'm no good at describing a girl's charms,
but even at the first glance her beautiful
violet eyes struck me. Blue eyes and black
lashes and eyebrows&mdash;it is a thing happens
over here sometimes, they tell me. Then,
though she'd been rushing about after the
ancient barnyard fowl who was to have
graced the table in my honour, she had no
more colour than a white rose; and yet
she looked the picture of health and life&mdash;so
different from fine ladies. This was Miss
Pamela&mdash;Pam for short&mdash;as I discovered later.
To finish her description, her charming head
is covered with a mass of short black curls.
She had a very shabby frock on, which
didn't take a bit from her loveliness. I
couldn't help wondering what the mater
would have thought if she could have seen
her. She would surely have called her 'a
young woman,' with that superb contempt of
hers.</p>

<p>"However, the breeding tells. Nothing
could have been finer than the little air with
which she pulled herself together, and said, as
if it were an every-day thing to blind and
maim your visitors:</p>

<p>"'You must be Sir Anthony Trevithick. I
am so sorry. That wretched fowl flew in
through the open window, and we've been
three-quarters of an hour chasing him round.
It was so unfortunate his flying out just at
that moment, and still more unfortunate
that I should have flung my bonnet after
him. But you've no idea how he had
aggravated us.'</p>

<p>"I assure you the mater couldn't have
done it better, if one could conceivably
imagine the mater under such circumstances.</p>

<p>"I could think of nothing to do but to
pick up the bonnet and hand it to her,
muttering some idiocy about it not mattering
a bit. While this was going on the laughter in
the chair was dying off in sobs of enjoyment.</p>

<p>"But before we could get any further Mr.
Graydon himself made his appearance. I
suppose something about my looks struck
him&mdash;for a cucumber wasn't in it for coolness
with Miss Pam&mdash;because he said, 'Why, bless
me, Sir Anthony! what's the matter? What's
the matter, Pam? Why, Sir Anthony, your
nose is bleeding!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/img117.jpg" width="450" height="575" alt="rooster" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"The old rooster struck me with his spurs."&mdash;<em>p.</em> 107.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"'Why, so it is!' said Miss Pam, calmly.
'Sir Anthony was trying to catch the red
cock, papa, with a view to his dinner, but
he's escaped, I'm sorry to say, and the dinner
with him. It will be days before he comes
home after the alarm we've given him. I'm
so sorry you're wounded, Sir Anthony. Can
I get you a little sticking-plaster?'</p>

<p>"'I never know where I shall find the fowls
in this house,' said Mr. Graydon, a little
irascibly, I thought; 'but the drawing-room
at least ought to be kept free from them. Why,
Sylvia, what are you doing there, child?
Come here, and speak to Sir Anthony.'</p>

<p>"I expected a small child to come out of
the big chair in answer to the summons;
but, lo and behold! out of the sun-bonnet
there looked another satin-cheeked damsel,
almost as beautiful as the first. She made
her bow demurely, and, I assure you, there
wasn't a feather out of her after her fits of
laughter at my expense. She had rather an
ecstatic look, and her eyes were a bit moist&mdash;that
was all. I can tell you I never felt so
small in my life as when I stood up before
those impudent girls, for I could see that
the pair of them were hugely delighted at
the whole affair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Get some tea for Sir Anthony, girls,'
said the father, 'and see that he has hot
water taken to his room; he's had a long
journey. Sit down, my lad&mdash;that is, if there's
a chair in the room without a dog on it.
Here, Mark Antony, you lazy animal, come
off that sofa.' This to the fattest bulldog
I ever saw&mdash;with such a jowl. He's Miss
Sylvia's, and an amiable dog, despite his
looks.</p>

<p>"Then the eldest daughter came in&mdash;not a
patch on the others for beauty, but a
Madonna of a creature, with a beautiful
voice and a rather sad expression. She was
greatly concerned about my scratched nose.
But all the time she was talking I noticed
that she looked at her father steadily reproachful.
At last he noticed it too, for he
suddenly blurted out:</p>

<p>"'Why, bless my soul! Molly, I forgot all
about it,' and then he stopped and laughed.
Miss Pamela has told me since that they had
instructed their father to keep me on the way
as long as possible.</p>

<p>"You'll gather that it is a rather rummy
place. It is. The windows in my bedroom
are mended with brown paper, and there are
holes in the floor you could put your foot
through. Not that my father's son need mind
little hardships. But I am amused to think
of what the mater would say, with her notions
of things.</p>

<p>"By the way, if you're in Brook Street any
time, don't repeat what I've told you. The
mater hated my coming here. She has some
extraordinary prejudice against Graydon,
though he scarcely seems to remember her.
But as I've given up my desire for soldiering
to please her, it's my turn now to please
myself by reading for this Foreign Office grind
with my father's old friend.</p>

<p>"A word more and I am done. You'll
think me as long-winded as some of those
old women at the clubs. But their ways
here are too delicious. The establishment is
managed by one old woman&mdash;Bridget, who
seems mistress, maid, and man rolled, in one.
Well, the morning after I came, when I rang
for my shaving water there was no response.
At last I heard a foot go by my door, and
I looked out cautiously. It was Bridget, and
to her I made my request. 'Why, bless the
boy!' she said, staring at me, 'You haven't
been pullin' that old bell that's never rung
in the memory of man?' I assured her I had.
'Well, then,' she said, 'goodness help your
little wit! An' so ye want shavin' water, do
ye? Sure, I thought ye wor a bit of a boy,
that never wanted shavin' at all, at all!' However,
she brought me the water obligingly, in
an extraordinary piece of kitchen crockery.
'I suppose you're used to valetin',' she said.
''Twas Misther Mick spoiled me entirely for
other young gentlemen. He'd dart down
for his shavin' water&mdash;aye, many a time before
I had the kitchen fire lit.' Mr. Mick was
apparently a former pupil; I often hear of
him.</p>

<p>"There's any amount of sport here, but I
won't tantalise you. I like Graydon better
every day; he's a dear old boy, and though
he's in the clouds half the time when he's
supposed to be coaching me, I can see that he
knows more than half the tutors in London
put together. He's a delightful companion
out of doors, a good sportsman, and as young
as the youngest.</p>

<p>"It's a mystery his being buried here. But
I've no time to try to unriddle it now, and
you'll never get as far as this, I expect. Good-bye,
old fellow&mdash;I'm extremely well satisfied
with my present quarters, and pity you in
Knightsbridge. I suppose town is getting
empty."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When this enormous epistle was finished
and sealed, the young gentleman put it in
his pocket and went downstairs. His pace
was hastened by the fact that he could hear
the joyful yelping of dogs in the hall, from
which he gathered that someone besides himself
was bent on outdoor exercise. Indeed,
as he reached the hall and caught his hat
from one of the dusty antlers, he saw the
two younger Miss Graydons setting out amid
their leaping and yelping escorts. He hurried
after and overtook them.</p>

<p>"May I come with you?" he asked eagerly.
"I've a very important letter to post, and
if you're going to the village you might perhaps
point out the post-office. I'm such a
duffer at finding out things for myself."</p>

<p>"But we're turning our backs on the
village," said Miss Sylvia, "going in exactly
the opposite direction."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, then, it doesn't matter; the letter
can wait till another time."</p>

<p>"Though it is so important. Oh, but you
must post it. We'll put you on the way for
the village. You turn to the right and we
to the left when we reach the gate; then
you'll walk straight into the arms of the
post-office."</p>

<p>Pamela, who had not yet spoken, turned
her heavenly-coloured eyes on her sister, but
without speaking. Something in the look
made the young fellow's heart throb suddenly.</p>

<p>"Ah, Miss Sylvia," he said imploringly,
"don't put difficulties in my way. I want
to come for a walk, if you will have me, and
the letter can wait. I'm not contemplative
enough to enjoy a country walk alone; and
it will be a pleasure to walk with you and
your sister."</p>

<p>"And the dogs?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>"And the dogs. The joys of a country walk
are doubled in the society of dogs."</p>

<p>"I hope you'll think so when you have the
felicity of fishing them out of a bog-hole.
They will chase every beast they see; and
our neighbour, Jack Malone's black cow,
Polly, always leads them such a dance, ending
up deservedly in a bog-hole."</p>

<p>"I'll try to endure even that, Miss Sylvia."</p>

<p>"Then if Mark Antony gets a thorn in his
paw, as he almost invariably does, you'll have
to carry him home."</p>

<p>"He must weigh three stone, Miss Sylvia."</p>

<p>"About that, Sir Anthony."</p>

<p>"Then it is better I should carry him than
you."</p>

<p>"Oh, if you're bent on it, Sir Anthony."</p>

<p>"If you're not bent against it, Miss Sylvia."</p>

<p>"Well, come along then, for this is the
parting of the ways."</p>

<p>They had arrived at the gate by this time.</p>

<p>"Sylvia should have told you, Sir Anthony,
that though we turn our backs on the village,
yet we pass a wall letter-box, which the
postman empties on his way to Lettergort."</p>

<p>It was Pamela speaking for the first time,
and in this less hoydenish mood of hers she
had a likeness to her gentle elder sister.</p>

<p>"I'm not surprised to hear it, Miss Pamela.
I guessed Miss Sylvia was only piling up the
difficulties to tease me. But I was not to be
put off."</p>

<p>"You are really a most persistent person,
Sir Anthony."</p>

<p>"I know when I want a thing and mean
to get it, Miss Sylvia."</p>

<p>"Did you ever see anything more beautiful
than the rose-light on that mountain, Sir
Anthony?"</p>

<p>"I have seen more beautiful things, Miss
Pamela."</p>

<p>He spoke with the utmost simplicity, but
the girl blushed nevertheless, and was furious
with herself for blushing.</p>

<p>"See how rosy the peak is," she went on in
some confusion, "but the woods are purple
at the base. If we were over there where
the road winds round the hill-foot, we should
hear nothing but the singing of little streams.
They are chattering through the bracken
everywhere, and spilling into the road, where
they make little channels for themselves,
clear as amber."</p>

<p>"They make your boots very wet and your
skirt draggle-tailed," remarked Sylvia.</p>

<p>"I see chimneys rising above the wood," said
Sir Anthony. "Is there a house there, then?"</p>

<p>"There is, but it is empty at present. It
belongs to Lord Glengall, who is away just
now. It has a queer story attached to it."</p>

<p>"Indeed?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Lord Glengall went to Australia as
a boy, and was unheard of for years. His
mother lived there, with one old servant, in
the bitterest poverty. She was so proud no
one dared to interfere, until, it having been
noticed that the chimneys were smokeless
for days, the house was entered by force,
and mistress and maid were found dying of
starvation side by side. The house was full
of valuables&mdash;lace and plate, and all kinds of
lovely things&mdash;but they were heirlooms, and
the old lady would rather starve than sell
them, and the old servant was quite of the
same mind."</p>

<p>"What happened then?"</p>

<p>"They were taken off to the Rectory by
old Mr. Rogers, who died last year. And in
the nick of time Lord Glengall, whom everyone
said was dead, turned up safe and
sound to nurse his old mother. 'I kept
the things together for you, my boy,' she
said as soon as she recognised him.</p>

<p>"And the next thing she said," went on
Sylvia, taking up the tale, "was, 'Where's
that cat?' The faithfulness of animals, Sir
Anthony! Old Tib, with whom they had
shared all their short-commons, had, it seems,
stolen the very last drop of milk that stood
between them and starvation, and had then
escaped through a window into the woods.
'I should like to give him a good hiding
before I die.' That was the second speech
of the indomitable old lady."</p>

<p>"What a chance for the novelist this
country of yours presents!" said Sir Anthony.</p>

<p>"But that fortunately he never comes our
way," replied Pamela.</p>

<p>"Your father promised me you would take
me fishing one day." He spoke to Sylvia,
but his eyes turned from her to Pamela.</p>

<p>"So we shall," said Sylvia readily.</p>

<p>"The river runs quite close to the house?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but if you want the pleasantest
fishing, you must climb for it. Up there
in the hills are little golden-brown trout-streams
running through the valleys under
the shadow of woods, and they are full of
trout spoiling to be caught."</p>

<p>"You know the best places, Miss Sylvia."</p>

<p>"Don't let her guide you, Sir Anthony.
I'll tell you a story about her. She was always
tantalising Mick St. Leger, an old pupil of
papa's, who is in India now, with stories of
a wonderful pike which inhabited one of the
big holes in the Moyle. Well, poor Mick
used to sit and fish for hours, now and
then catching a little fish by accident, for
his heart wasn't in it for thinking of Sylvia's
big pike. And Sylvia used to sit by watching
him, apparently full of sympathy. One
day he was fishing the big hole as usual,
when he gave a long whistle. 'What is it,
Mick?' Sylvia cried, running to him. 'It
feels like a twenty-pounder,' said poor Mick,
very red in the face. 'Oh, Mick, do let me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
help!' cried Sylvia. And then, with an immense
deal of carefulness, and poor Mick holding
on like grim death, they reeled up an old
tin can full of stones, in the handle of
which Mick's line was caught."</p>

<p>"Mick would never have known," said
Sylvia dispassionately, "if little Patsy Murray
hadn't come running after me a week later,
calling out, 'Where's that apple ye promised
me for sinkin' me mother's ould can
in the river?' Mick never believed in me
as an honest angler afterwards."</p>

<p>"No wonder! But to think your father
should have suggested you as my guide,
Miss Sylvia!"</p>

<p>"Pam's just as bad, Sir Anthony. I generally
do the things, but Pam encourages me."</p>

<p>Pamela again turned those eyes of heaven's
own colour in mute reproach upon her sister.</p>

<p>"I'll have faith in you, Miss Pam," said
Sir Anthony impulsively, "no matter what
your sister says to the contrary."</p>

<p>And he meant his rash promise.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>THE WISHING WELL.</h3>


<p>"My friends generally call me Tony,"
said a voice, the youthful growl
of which was subdued to all
possible softness.</p>

<p>"We have known each other such a little
while," replied Pamela, looking down at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
ground, which had begun to cover itself in
the flying gold of the autumn woods.</p>

<p>"As the calendar counts; but we&mdash;'we
count time by heart-throbs'&mdash;doesn't somebody
say that?"</p>

<p>A colour, like a pink rose-leaf, warmed in
Pamela's clear cheek.</p>

<p>"We have become very good friends," she
said, "seeing that it is only six&mdash;or is it
seven?&mdash;weeks ago since we met."</p>

<p>"It is eight," said the youth. "I came in
mid-July, and now it is mid-September.
But it sometimes seems to me that I have
always been here, and that my life elsewhere
was but a dream."</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/img121.jpg" width="350" height="500" alt="wishes" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"Tell me what you wished for?"</p></div>
</div>

<p>"If that were so," she said demurely&mdash;and
for a moment the violet eyes looked up
at him under their shadow of night&mdash;"if
that were so, then I might really call you
by your name, Sir Anthony. But it is too
soon."</p>

<p>"Then you will one day, Miss Pamela?
How many days must go by first? You
called that other man&mdash;St. Leger&mdash;by his
name. It is 'Mick' with all of you."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Pamela, again with the bewildering
glance; "but Mick was Mick, you
see."</p>

<p>A sudden irrational anger kindled in the
young man's eye, and his
expression stiffened.</p>

<p>"Oh, I see," he said.
"This paragon had special
privileges which no one
else may hope to share."</p>

<p>"He certainly had,"
said Pamela. "For no
one else would endure
them, poor dear!"</p>

<p>"Now, what do you
mean by that?" he said
doubtfully. "Do you
mean the privilege of
being called by his
name?"</p>

<p>"No, but the privilege
of my society and
Sylvia's."</p>

<p>"He must have been
jolly hard to please."</p>

<p>"He wasn't, then. He
was as easily pleased as
a child. I should like to
have seen you in some of
the situations in which
Mick distinguished himself."</p>

<p>"I daresay I'd be
very undistinguished. I
make no pretence of
being a paragon."</p>

<p>"It would be useless
to, Sir Anthony."</p>

<p>"I don't dispute it,
Miss Pamela. I suppose
we'd better be making
for home?"</p>

<p>He turned and walked
sulkily along the forest
path with the girl by
his side. For a second
there was silence; then
Pamela broke it by saying
softly:</p>

<p>"I often have thought
that one reason why Molly fell in love with
Mick was because she pitied him so much.
He came to the wall in all our escapades.
Of course, he was always in love with
Molly, but I believe it was in protecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
him from us that she became so fond of
him."</p>

<p>"He is your sister's lover, then?" incredulously.</p>

<p>"Why, <em>of course</em> he is. Whose did you
suppose he was?"</p>

<p>"Yours, Miss Pamela."</p>

<p>"Mine! why, he'd never look at me when
Molly was by. Besides, you don't know how
horribly we ill-used the poor dear fellow."</p>

<p>"Miss Pam, I wish you'd ill-use me."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't like it at all, Sir Anthony."</p>

<p>"Yes, I should, Miss Pamela. So Mick is
engaged to your sister. What an ass I have
been!"</p>

<p>"Yes, poor dears, they are engaged, without
the remotest prospect of ever being
married that I can see. Mick's a subaltern in
a line regiment, with just his pay&mdash;he got
in through the Militia&mdash;and Molly, needless
to say, hasn't a penny."</p>

<p>"He's a lucky fellow, all the same. And
now, Miss Pamela, what have we been quarrelling
about?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know, Sir Anthony.
Have we been quarrelling?"</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> have."</p>

<p>"But I haven't. I did think you were a
little cross about something. But here is
the Wishing Well that I told you about."</p>

<p>They had come on a little glade of the
forest, in the midst of which was a brier
heavy with blackberries. The bush hooded
a little space, and, looking underneath, one
saw, as in a cup, a still depth of water over
pebbles of gold and silver.</p>

<p>"You are to drink, Sir Anthony, without
spilling a drop, and think on your wish at
the same time."</p>

<p>"Drink from what, Miss Pamela?"</p>

<p>"Why, from your hands, of course."</p>

<p>"I couldn't; the water would all run
away."</p>

<p>"No, it wouldn't. See how I manage it."</p>

<p>The girl scooped the water into her rosy
palms and drank it slowly. Then she looked
at him, and again the wave of rose flowed
in her cheek.</p>

<p>"I never could manage it; I'm such a
duffer at things. Miss Pamela, would you
let me drink from your hands? <em>Do!</em>"</p>

<p>Without a word she stooped and lifted
the water and held it to him. He drank from
the rosy cup to the last drop. Then he
suddenly caught the hands that had served
him, and pressed them to his lips. For a
moment they were yielded to him, and then
the girl drew back. He thought she trembled
a little, and the ardour in his gaze grew.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," he said, "but I couldn't
help it. You are not angry, Miss Pamela?"</p>

<p>"I am going home, Sir Anthony," she said.</p>

<p>"Not till you tell me one thing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He barred her way, putting himself in front
of her. "Tell me what you wished for."</p>

<p>Her eyes fell before his, and as she stood
with her hands clasped, and her head bent,
she was a different creature from the wild
Pamela of a few short weeks ago. The sunlight
through the thinned branches fell on
her short curls, for her hat&mdash;which she had
been swinging by a ribbon&mdash;had fallen to
her feet.</p>

<p>"Look at me," he said; "I want to see
what is in your eyes."</p>

<p>She lifted them obediently, and then let
them fall again.</p>

<p>"Ah, that is enough," he said, with exultation
in his voice. "You have answered
me, Pam. That is enough just for the present.
Some day I shall tell you what I
wished for, and we shall see if our wishes
come true. A double wish should have double
force to induce its fulfilment. Isn't it so,
Pam?"</p>

<p>She said nothing, and he looked at her
with triumph shining in his eyes. Blent
with it was the tenderness of a lover when
he knows he is loved, and just a shade of
shamefacedness as well.</p>

<p>"We must be wise, little beautiful Pamela,"
he said presently, in a low voice. "We
must be wise and wait. I mustn't ask yet
all I would ask, but I will one day&mdash;one
good day, Pamela. You will trust me, won't
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Pamela, hardly knowing what
she was asked.</p>

<p>"It will not be for long. Indeed, I could
not endure it for long. Shall we be friends for
a little while longer, Pamela darling?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Pamela, forgetting to rebuke
him.</p>

<p>"After to-day I will not call you darling
till I have the right before all the world.
After to-day. I meant to have held my
tongue, but you bewildered me, Pamela. You
are not angry with me?"</p>

<p>"No," came almost in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Lift up your eyes to me and say it. That
is right. How beautiful your eyes are, Pamela!
Say 'Tony,' now."</p>

<p>"Tony!"</p>

<p>"Dear Tony."</p>

<p>"Dear Tony!"</p>

<p>"How sweetly you say it! It is like silver
in your voice. But, come now, we will go
home. I have to be wise, you know. Ah,
Pamela, Pamela! why did you bring me to
the Wishing Well?"</p>

<p>"You wanted to go."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know; but it was an accident that
we were alone, or it was Fate&mdash;yes, it was
surely Fate that sent Miss Spencer's carriage
for your sister at the last moment, so that
we had to take our walk without her. Shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
we go now, and talk no more about love
to-day?"</p>

<p>Pamela hesitated, and then said:</p>

<p>"Poor Sylvia! She has spent this lovely
afternoon shut up with an old lady and a
dog."</p>

<p>"She wouldn't mind the dog, I fancy,
Pam."</p>

<p>"Nor the old lady. Sylvia is fond of Miss
Spencer, strange as it may seem."</p>

<p>"Why is it strange, Pam? I can't help
using the sweet little name."</p>

<p>He had taken her hand by this time, and
they were walking like children down the
aisle of golden trees.</p>

<p>"You haven't seen Miss Spencer. She is a
little mad and a little grotesque to most people.
But she is devoted to Sylvia, and Sylvia to
her. She is not mad to Sylvia."</p>

<p>"How does it come that I haven't seen
Miss Spencer?"</p>

<p>"She has been abroad. You'll see her one
of these days, I expect. She was crossed in
love in her youth, and it seems to have made
her strange in ways. She's immensely wealthy,
and gives a good deal in charity, but mostly
among single women. She seems to think
that those who have husbands and children
don't need pity."</p>

<p>"She's quite safe for your sister to be
with?"</p>

<p>"Oh, quite. She has all her senses, only
that she's a trifle peculiar. She's a splendid
business woman, everyone says."</p>

<p>"It is a curious friendship. I should never
have supposed it of Miss Sylvia."</p>

<p>"No. One funny thing is that Miss Spencer's
full of sentiment&mdash;wait till you hear
her sing 'She wore a Wreath of Roses'&mdash;whereas
Sylvia's quite without sentiment, and
laughs at everything sentimental."</p>

<p>"I feel sorry for the poor old thing," said
Sir Anthony, with a half-ashamed laugh, "because
she was crossed in love. I shouldn't
like to be crossed in love myself, Pamela."</p>

<p>"It was cruel," said Pamela simply. "The
man made her love him, and then went away
and never came back. She was poor then.
She inherited Dovercourt quite unexpectedly."</p>

<p>"What a sweep he must have been!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/img123.jpg" width="450" height="467" alt="Trevithick" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"Come along, Trevithick," he cried, rushing away.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>"Poor Miss Spencer always thinks he will
come back, though people say he married
abroad and died there. I tell you all this
so that you won't be the least bit in the
world inclined to laugh when you see her.
I daresay it's funny enough to see a pink
silk coal-scuttle bonnet on top of a grey
head; but then, you know, you don't feel
like laughing."</p>

<p>"No, indeed, darling."</p>

<p>"Sylvia says it's made a man-hater of her.
That's how she excuses herself for treating
her admirers so outrageously."</p>

<p>"I'd have fallen in love with Sylvia myself,
only for you, Pamela."</p>

<p>"It's lucky you didn't, Tony." The name
came with soft hesitation.</p>

<p>"Why, Pam?"</p>

<p>"She'd have laughed in your face."</p>

<p>"I'd rather have your way, Pam."</p>

<p>"My way?"</p>

<p>"Though it made me behave worse than
I intended. But never mind. A little time
will unravel the tangled skein. Now we
are nearly out of the wood. Ah, Pamela!
kiss me once&mdash;I shall not ask you again till
I have the full right."</p>

<p>Without a word the girl lifted her face to meet
his kiss. To her it was the kiss of betrothal.</p>




<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>"I WILL COME AGAIN, MY DEAR."</h3>


<p>"I wish my friend, Glengall, were at
home," said Mr. Graydon, leaning
back in the chair by the study fire.
"He'd give you a mount while you
were waiting for Johnny Maher's little mare.
The hounds meet at Lettergort to-day."</p>

<p>He looked wistfully through the bare trees
on the lawn, as though he saw in imagination
the scarlet horsemen pounding away after
the streaming line of hounds.</p>

<p>His pupil thrust into a book a sketch of
Pamela which he had been making absent-mindedly.</p>

<p>"Why don't you hunt, sir?" he asked, with
sympathy.</p>

<p>"So I do, my lad, when I can. But I
can't afford to keep a horse, and there aren't
many mounts to be had here. Glengall is
going to set up stables when he comes back,
and I'll have the run of them, I suppose.
He's a good fellow&mdash;one wouldn't mind
being obliged to him."</p>

<p>"The mare'll be a good one when she's
broken," said the young man.</p>

<p>"The best in the world for Irish fences, if
she does look a bit roughish."</p>

<p>"You'll ride her for me, when I am away
at Christmas, to get her mouth in?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, my lad; I should like to."
Mr. Graydon's eye kindled with pleasure.
"But I didn't know you were going. It
seems a longish way to go home for Christmas."</p>

<p>"My mother would like to see me."</p>

<p>"To be sure, to be sure. I quite understand,
and, of course, there are friends in London
you naturally want to see."</p>

<p>"No one very particularly, sir."</p>

<p>"Ah, well! it will be a holiday from this dull
place."</p>

<p>"No, I assure you, sir. It is partly because
I have some&mdash;some business I want to settle.
It is really true that there is no one I go to
see whom I regard more than the friends I
shall be leaving behind."</p>

<p>Sir Anthony blushed hotly over this avowal,
but his unsuspicious host only saw in it
the shamefacedness with which a man, and
especially a young man, makes a display of
his feelings.</p>

<p>"Now, that is kind of you," he said, looking
at his pupil benignantly. "I am sure our
Christmas will be dull without you. Do the
girls know you are going? They won't like
it, eh? And they will be disappointed that
you will not be here for the Vandaleur
affair."</p>

<p>"I am coming back for that, sir."</p>

<p>"I am glad. It is really the children's first
outing. It is a dull enough affair for young
people, but then they will wear their pretty
frocks and see strange faces. We are such
quiet people, Trevithick, that even Vandaleur's
big dinner and reception, which comes off
regularly whenever there is a general election
in sight"&mdash;Mr. Graydon broke off to laugh
and rub his hands&mdash;"is an event for us. But
we are forgetting our Tacitus, my boy. Let us
get back to the old fellow."</p>

<p>At that moment there was the sound
of a horn, and, with the shout of a boy, Mr.
Graydon was up.</p>

<p>"Come along, Trevithick," he cried, rushing
away, hatless and coatless. "We shall
get a glimpse of them. What a day for
a scent! They are sure to find at Larry's
Spinney."</p>

<p>His words came back to his pupil, who was
getting under weigh more leisurely.</p>

<p>"Dear old boy!" he muttered to himself.
"It's not surprising my father never forgot
him. I wonder why the mater regards him
with so deadly a hatred, though?"</p>

<p>At lunch Mr. Graydon announced that Sir
Anthony was going home for Christmas. There
was a shrill expostulation from Sylvia, and
even a mild protest from Mary, but Pamela
said nothing. Perhaps it was not news to
Pamela.</p>

<p>"You will not be here for the skating," said
Sylvia aggrievedly; "that is, if there's going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
to be any. And I've promised them at the
Rectory that you'd recite at their penny
reading and give away the presents at the
Christmas-tree, besides managing the magic
lantern. And, oh!"&mdash;the magnitude of the
misfortune coming full upon her&mdash;"you're not
surely going to miss the Vandaleur dinner?"</p>

<p>"No, Miss Sylvia, I shall be here for it
certainly. I wouldn't miss it for anything;
but I object to your engagements for me
with the Rectory people. I'd rather be shot
than recite, and&mdash;the other things are beyond
me," laughing.</p>

<p>"Never mind, then," said the young lady
airily. "Lord Glengall will do just as well.
I shall like to see him distributing the
articles. Besides, he will please the people
better than a 'baronite,' and be of the rale
ould blood, too."</p>

<p>"Sylvia!" said her father, with a rebuke in
his voice.</p>

<p>"Never mind, papa dear. Sir Anthony
understands all about his being only a
'baronite.' Bridget told him the other day
that if the master had his rights 'tisn't
teaching a 'Sir' he'd be."</p>

<p>"So she did," said Sir Anthony.</p>

<p>Mr. Graydon laughed.</p>

<p>"Ah, well, my boy! you mustn't tell your
mother what odd people you've found among
the wild Irish&mdash;will you?"</p>

<p>"She wouldn't understand a bit, but I'll
tell her what dear friends I have found
and made at Carrickmoyle."</p>

<p>He blushed again, and Mr. Graydon
thought how well his modesty became him.</p>

<p>"Ah, well!" he said, "I suppose we must
make up our minds to spend Christmas
without you. What are you going to do
this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to Maher's to see the mare,
and put her through her paces. I'd like to
have her stabled here as soon as possible.
If she's ready, she can come at once."</p>

<p>"To be sure. There's stabling for twenty
horses here, though the stalls are bare&mdash;worse
luck! But we won't let Sheila starve. Shall
we, girls? I'll go bail these children will
make a fine pet of her, Trevithick."</p>

<p>"I shall be all the fonder of her, sir, though
I'm well pleased with her at present."</p>

<p>"She's a sweet little bit of horseflesh,"
assented Mr. Graydon. "I think I shall come
with you, if you don't object to my company.
I've a bit of business with Johnny myself."</p>

<p>When they returned in time for the afternoon
cup of tea, they found an old yellow
barouche standing before the door.</p>

<p>"Ah, Miss Spencer is here," said Mr.
Graydon. "She's rather an oddity, my boy,
so prepare to meet one."</p>

<p>"I heard her story from Miss Pamela. It
is very sad."</p>

<p>"When I was a boy of thirteen or fourteen
I remember her a brilliantly lovely young
woman. That was before that scoundrel came
in her way."</p>

<p>When they entered the drawing-room Miss
Spencer was sitting with her back to them,
almost hidden in a deep armchair. The three
girls were sitting or standing about her, all
evidently much interested.</p>

<p>"Here is papa, and our guest with him,
Miss Spencer," said Mary.</p>

<p>The little old woman came out of her chair
with a sudden darting movement like that of
a bird. Her gaze went from Mr. Graydon to
the younger man.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she cried. "Whom did you say?"</p>

<p>She looked at the stranger for a moment
with an agony of expectation in her yet
bright eyes, while she fumbled nervously for
the long-handled glasses at her side. When
she had found them she peered at him
through them; then dropped them, the expression
of her face changing to indifference.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, sir," she said. "I am
expecting a friend, and for a moment I
thought you were he."</p>

<p>"How do you do, Miss Spencer?" broke
in Mr. Graydon. "I see you have Stella
under the barouche again. I'm glad she has
recovered from her lameness."</p>

<p>"The foot has come all right, thank you,"
said Miss Spencer, assuming quite an ordinary
manner. "You weren't hunting to-day?"</p>

<p>"No; I must wait till Glengall sets up his
stables."</p>

<p>"Ah, Glengall is coming home soon?"</p>

<p>"He expects to reach Plymouth on the
eighteenth. He will be at home for Christmas."</p>

<p>"There'll be nothing in order for him in
that old barrack of his."</p>

<p>"He'll stay here while he's getting things
straight. He is going to make a grand
place of Glengall. He has plenty of money,
and the heart to spend it, and the practical
wit to direct it."</p>

<p>"What will he do with it then? He has
neither chick nor child."</p>

<p>"There is always time, Miss Spencer."</p>

<p>The slightly mad, brooding look came back
to the little wizened white face.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course, there is time," she said,
dreamily. "I remember someone&mdash;who was
it?&mdash;who knew Glengall when she was a
young woman and he was a little boy.
Glengall can't be old, of course, and any
day people may return&mdash;mayn't they?"</p>

<p>"Why, to be sure they may. Glengall did,
though he was twenty years out of the
reach of civilisation."</p>

<p>"Oh, I wasn't thinking of Glengall. It
was of someone much younger, someone about
the age of that young gentleman there."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>Trevithick stood in the background and
watched her with honest eyes of wonder
and pity. She was smoothing the pink silk
of her gown, while her eyes watched the
fire as if she saw something very happy in
it. Her skin was waxen white, and her
features sharpened, but the brilliant eyes
kept their beauty, and her little old hands,
covered with rings, were delicately shaped.
Her hair was half-white through the original
black, and very oddly her pink bonnet, with
its wreath of roses inside, sat on the streaked
hair and over the white face. She had thrown
off a large sable cloak on to the back of her
chair.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/img126.jpg" width="450" height="439" alt="watched" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Trevithick watched her with wonder and pity.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Sylvia now broke in on Miss Spencer's half-mad
mood. She touched one of the hands
tenderly. Trevithick, as he noticed it, thought
that it was the first time he had seen Sylvia's
face really soft; and wonderfully the new
expression completed the girl's beauty. So
she will look, he thought, some day, when
she is in love, like&mdash;like Pamela. But Pamela's
serious face was hidden from him now with
a fire-screen she held in her hand. He had
noticed of late that she seldom looked at
him, nor was he displeased. He knew the
secret she was afraid to reveal.</p>

<p>"We are all going to the Vandaleur
affair, Miss Spencer," Sylvia was saying. "It
will be on the thirtieth. There are to be great
doings&mdash;acres of marquees for the diners, and
the winter garden lit by electricity, and I
don't know what besides."</p>

<p>Miss Spencer came back to every-day life
with a start.</p>

<p>"To the Vandaleur affair, child! Why,
who is going to take you?"</p>

<p>"Papa, of course. He loves a little outing,
though he won't admit it. He says he'd
rather stay at home and have a quiet night's
work at his book, and get some hot tea
ready for us by the time we come home."</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I take you?" said the old
lady. "I'm hardly old enough for a chaperon,
of course, still I've the carriage, and I'd
enjoy the function. I haven't been at one
since the time Tom Charteris was master of
the hounds. How long ago is that?"</p>

<p>Mr. Graydon, to whom she spoke, answered
her without looking at her.</p>

<p>"A goodish few years ago."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>"It can't be," said the old lady; "not more
than four or five at the outside. I wore
white satin and pearls. That reminds me:
what are you going to wear, minx?"</p>

<p>This to Sylvia, at the same time softly
pulling her ear.</p>

<p>"We've got pattern-books of silk stuffs
from Dublin. They're dirt-cheap; but the
dressmaking will be the bother. However, I
daresay we'll manage. Mrs. Collins' Nancy,
who is a lady's-maid, is expected home for
Christmas. She'll cut the frocks out, and
we'll sew them ourselves. She'll know the
fashions."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/img127.jpg" width="450" height="450" alt="must go" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"I must go, to unravel a tangled skein."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Stuff and nonsense, child! Your first
public appearance, too."</p>

<p>"It's Pam's also. But you'll see we'll look
very nice. I shouldn't be surprised if the
prince fell in love with me."</p>

<p>"What prince? Oh, I see, Cinderella's.
But Cinderella went magnificently to her
evening party&mdash;not in cheap and nasty
stuffs cobbled up anyhow."</p>

<p>"The prince wouldn't see that. He'd be
disconsolate when I disappeared at twelve
o'clock, and he'd send all over the country
to find the fit of my glass slipper, and
Molly and Pam would cry tears of rage because
it wouldn't even fit on their toes."</p>

<p>"You're not ball-going, minx."</p>

<p>"It will be just as good. There'll be a
beautiful dinner, and everyone in the
county there, and afterwards there will be
acres of beautiful things to see. It is a
thousand pities Mr. Vandaleur is an absentee."</p>

<p>"If he wasn't, he wouldn't have to remind
you of his existence now," said the old
lady cynically. "But am I to be chaperon?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'll tell you what, Miss Spencer,"
said Mr. Graydon. "If you'd take charge of
these children, I'd be greatly obliged to you.
The fact is that I've to attend a sort of
unofficial meeting of Vandaleur's supporters
in the afternoon, and he has hospitably
offered me a bed. So I thought I'd take
my bag over and dress there after the meeting."</p>

<p>"And stay all night? I knew it," cried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Sylvia. "Papa pretended it was such a
bother, and all the time he was longing to
be in for every bit of it. Only he didn't
know what to do with us."</p>

<p>Mr. Graydon laughed.</p>

<p>"Maybe you wouldn't like it yourself. I
shall be button-holed by Musgrave and
Frost and Clitheroe, and every man in the
county who thinks he has a head for politics
and wants a patient listener."</p>

<p>"And you will go at it hammer and
tongs with the best of them, and forget
you have daughters. I don't suppose you'll
even remember at dinner-time to see whether
anyone is asking us if we've an appetite."</p>

<p>"The young fellows will do that. Every
boy in the county will be there, including the
300th from Dangan Barracks."</p>

<p>"I daresay," said Sylvia: "you're always
ready to shift your responsibilities. Never
mind, Miss Spencer; I daresay we shall be
able to find someone who will look after us,
if it's only a waiter."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed, you'll find someone to befriend
you, never fear. And so will Pam.
And so shall I. But what about Molly?"</p>

<p>"Never mind me, Miss Spencer," said Mary.
"It would never do to have you chaperoning
three girls, and I shouldn't enjoy it a bit. I
shall stay up and have tea for you after your
cold drive."</p>

<p>"I don't know what girls are coming to,"
said Miss Spencer; "I shouldn't like to have
to stay at home myself."</p>

<p>"We don't mind Molly," cried her sisters;
"she really likes to stay at home and write
her perpetual letters."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't mind having the three of
you," went on Miss Spencer; "we'd pass for
four sisters."</p>

<p>"We should never look as lovely as you
in that white satin and pearls," said Sylvia,
fondly.</p>

<p>"I was much admired," said Miss Spencer,
complacently. "But now I must be going.
I've letters to write before dinner: I don't
want to lose my beauty-sleep sitting up to
write them."</p>

<p>When Sir Anthony came into the drawing-room
before dinner, he found only Pamela
stretching her hands to the wood fire in the
low grate.</p>

<p>The lover stooped down and kissed them.</p>

<p>"Have you been out?" he asked in a
whisper.</p>

<p>"Only to the stables with Sylvia. Your
Sheila has come. She is a dear thing."</p>

<p>"You like her, Pam?"</p>

<p>"Who could help it? She looks so wild and
shy, and she is so gentle at the same time."</p>

<p>"Do you like her because she is mine, Pam?
Do you, just a little because of that? Say you
do, Pam."</p>

<p>"Just a little," whispered Pam.</p>

<p>"Why, if you like, she shall be yours, when&mdash;when
everything has come right. I think
she would carry a lady beautifully. What do
you say, Pam? Would you like her, <em>then</em>?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Pamela, with her eyes very
bright.</p>

<p>"You didn't seem to mind my going away
at Christmas, Pam. You were the only one
who didn't protest."</p>

<p>"I know you wouldn't go if you could
help it."</p>

<p>"Wise little woman. I must go, darling&mdash;to
unravel a tangled skein. Afterwards it
will be paradise, Pam. I will come back as
soon&mdash;as soon as ever I can. I shall be in a
fury of impatience till I come back."</p>

<p>"And I," said Pam, lifting her eyes to her
lover, and flooding him with their light.</p>

<p>"Sweetheart! you were a coquette when
I knew you first, Pam. Now you don't try
me as many girls try their lovers."</p>

<p>"I have only love for you now. Ah! what
should I do if you did not come back?"</p>

<p>"I will come back, 'though 'twere ten
thousand mile.' I shall be here for your great
function. Do you think I would have you
go without me?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't care for it without you."</p>

<p>"There will be other men there, Pamela,
to see how beautiful you are. I must be there
to guard my own."</p>

<p>"There is no need for that."</p>

<p>"I believe you, my love, you are as much
mine as if you were my wife. And I am as
much yours."</p>

<p>"Love can only mean that."</p>

<p>"Ah, my darling! how sweet you are!
You wouldn't care for the admiration of other
men, Pam?"</p>

<p>"Only for one."</p>

<p>"It is hard to be wise, Pam, when I am
with you. You are too sweet. It is fortunate
I am going."</p>

<p>"When you come back it will be different."</p>

<p>"Yes; you will have to make up to me
for my prudence all these months. I have
been good, Pam; I have never asked you for
a kiss."</p>

<p>"Yes, you have been good."</p>

<p>"And you, you are a girl in ten thousand.
You have never asked me what stood between
us&mdash;a shadowy barrier, Pam, but even
that must go before I claim you, my queen.
When I come back, Pam! Ah, when I come
back!"</p>

<p>"Here is Molly," said Pam, in a low voice,
as her sister entered the room.</p>

<h2>GREAT ANNIVERSARIES</h2>

<h3><em>IN DECEMBER.</em></h3>

<p class="center">By the Rev. A. R. Buckland, M.A., Morning Preacher at the Foundling Hospital.</p>


<p>December
is a
month
of great
names. On December
21st,
1117, according
to some authorities,
there was
born, in a house
that stood on
the site of the
Mercers' Chapel
in Cheapside,
Thomas à
Becket.
Whether men
side with
Church or State,
and are for or
against Becket, they will hardly deny him the
right to be remembered as an outstanding figure
in our history. On the last day of the month
died another great Englishman; like Becket,
an Oxford man, and a potent factor in the
religious development of our nation. On December
31st there passed away at Lutterworth
John Wycliffe. His bones, thirteen years after
burial, were dragged from their resting-place
and cast into the River Swift. Thomas Fuller
turns that
shameful act of
ecclesiastical
malice to good
use. "Thus,"
he says, "this
brook did convey
his ashes
into the Avon,
the Avon into
the Severn, the
Severn into the
narrow sea, and
this into the
wide ocean. And
so the ashes of
Wycliffe are the
emblem of his
doctrine, which
is now dispersed
all the world over." On the 13th of the
month, many generations later, there came
into the world Arthur Penrhyn Stanley, an
ecclesiastic of still another type. No modern
dean ever identified himself with his
cathedral as Stanley did with Westminster
Abbey. Its national character was always
present to his mind. His simple piety, his
good works, his sympathy with Nonconformists,
all helped to make the Dean
himself rather a national possession than
merely an ecclesiastic. He died in 1881.</p>

<p>We have had the Church, let us come to
the State. It is a rich month that claims the
birth both of
William Ewart
Gladstone (December
29th)
and of his
great rival,
Benjamin Disraeli,
Earl of
Beaconsfield
(December
20th). They
began their
careers under
very different
auspices. Eton
and Oxford
prepared the
one for immediate
entry,
under favouring
circumstances,
into Parliamentary life.
The other
was educated privately, designed for the
law, and first caught the public eye as
an author when he burst upon the world
with the novel, "Vivian Grey." Mr. Gladstone
survived his rival seventeen years.</p>

<p>There died on December 14th one whom the
British nation can only number amongst its
own worthies by adoption. The death of the
Prince Consort in the prime of life, and just
when his very considerable powers and great
devotion were beginning to be understood by
those who at first regarded him with doubt
because he was a foreigner, plunged our
Queen into sorrow which long darkened the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
life of the Court and was felt by the whole
nation. The pure, unblemished life of the
Prince Consort, his sincere desire to advance
the welfare of the people, his ready promotion
of the arts and sciences, as well as
his tender devotion to the Queen, have long
been understood and valued by the nation
which he served.</p>

<p>To come to other fields: there was born in
London on December 9th, 1608, John Milton.
Educated at Cambridge, he early gave free
play to the powers which in their issue have
made his name familiar wherever the English
language is spoken. Few remember him as
a writer of polemical treatises on affairs of
the State and the Church, or even as Latin
Secretary to
Cromwell; but
he was an old
man and blind
when he gave
the world "Paradise
Lost."</p>

<p>On the 12th
there died
Robert Browning,
a poet who
spoke to his age
as few men have
ever done, and
spoke of God
and the soul,
of the here and
the hereafter,
with a clearness
of faith which
was as distinct
as the robust manliness of his character.</p>

<p>December 28th is given as the date upon
which Westminster Abbey was consecrated
in 1065; and on December 2nd that other
minster, St. Paul's Cathedral, was opened in
1697. Legend says that the same King Sebert
who founded the
original St. Paul's
also founded the
Abbey at Westminster,
whilst
another story invokes
the aid of
King Offa. There
is, however, clear
testimony to the
establishment of
a Benedictine
abbey at Westminster
in the
time of Edgar;
that is antiquity
respectable
enough to satisfy
most of us. A
cathedral on this
site is mentioned
by the Venerable Bede as early as 604; but
the actual fabric of St. Paul's has, according
to Mr. Loftie, undergone greater vicissitudes
than that of any other cathedral in England.
The present St. Paul's was begun in 1675 and
finished in 1710. Its cost was £736,752. Sir
Christopher Wren, its architect, received for
his services £200 a year. What were then
called "the new ball and cross" on the cathedral
were completed in this same month
in 1821.</p>

<p>An old calendar assures me that on the
15th of this month, in the year 1802, "societies
for abolishing the common method of sweeping
chimneys" were instituted.</p>

<p>On the 20th of this month, in the year 1814,
Samuel Marsden landed in New Zealand&mdash;a
missionary anniversary worth recalling.</p>

<p><em>Pulpit at Gloucester Cathedral.</em></p>

<p>A Sermon Preached by the
Very Rev. H. Donald M.
Spence, D.D., Dean of
Gloucester, at the Opening Service
of the September (1898) Meeting of
the Three-Choirs Festival in Gloucester
Cathedral.</p>

<h2>The Limits of Human Genius</h2>
<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">"As for Wisdom, what she is, and how she came up, I will tell you, and will not hide mysteries from you, but will
seek her out from the beginning of her nativity, and bring the knowledge of her into Light, and will not
pass over Truth."</p></blockquote>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/img131b.jpg" alt="T" width="100" height="112" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_1">The surroundings of a
custodian of a mediæval
cathedral, beautiful
though they are,
at the same time are
unutterably pathetic.
They tell him, do the
pages of the old solemn
Book of Stone he is
never weary of turning over and of pondering
upon, that the genius of man has its
limits, which it may never pass; that the
story of human progress to higher and ever
higher levels is often a delusive one; that
in past ages his forefathers were perhaps
as noble and chivalrous&mdash;aye, nobler, more
chivalrous than the men of his own generation&mdash;that
their imagination was more
brilliant and their hands more cunning;
that if in some respects progress is visible,
in others the movement is retrograde.</p>
</div>

<p>Again, a great mediæval cathedral like
our own glorious Gloucester, inimitable in
its fadeless beauty and matchless strength,
surely deals a very heavy blow to human
pride, and it teaches humility to the most
competent and ablest of our number, for it
is a conception belonging to a past age. A
great gathering, however, like the present,
numbering some six or seven thousand
persons, is for varied reasons an inspiring
one and bids us be trustful&mdash;even hopeful.</p>

<p>Dwell we a brief while first on our
surroundings. Of all works devised by
human ingenuity and carried on by human
skill, the triumphs of architecture are
among the most enduring, afford the most
genuine and purest delight to the greater
number of men and women, are confessedly
the most attractive, perhaps the most
instructive, as they are among the most
enduring of human creations. The glories
of Luxor and Karnak, which for several
thousand years have been mirrored in the
grey-green Nile; the white and gleaming
shrines of Athens the bright and happy,
the mighty ruins of Eternal Rome, are
splendid instances.</p>

<p>But perhaps the conspicuous examples
of this architecture, the most loved of
human arts and crafts, are, after all, the
mediæval cathedrals. The first object of
interest for the modern traveller in search
of health or rest is a cathedral. All sorts
and conditions of men find delight in its
contemplation. The delight, of course, is
varied, but the strange and witching
beauty appeals to them all. This appeal to
the higher and devotional side of our nature
speaks to every soul, to the unlearned
as to the learned, to the mill-hand as to
the scholar. The wanderer from the New
World beyond the seas at once seeks them
out, conscious that in them he will find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
a beauty and a joy such as he will never
see or feel outside their charmed walls.</p>

<p>I have said that to the custodian of
such a cathedral the surroundings are,
if not sad, at least pathetic, for these
magnificent and loved creations of human
genius belong to a somewhat remote past,
and, as far as these exquisite buildings are
concerned, save for purposes of necessary
repair&mdash;repair simply to arrest the ravages
of time&mdash;for nearly four hundred years the
clink of trowel and pickaxe has been hushed.</p>

<p>It is scarcely an exaggerated statement
which speaks of architecture, in its noblest
sense, as a lost art. Very significant are
the words of one of the greatest of modern
architects, who, after dwelling on the
decadence of his loved art, tells us how
"It is a somewhat saddening reflection&mdash;but
there is no escaping from the
conclusion&mdash;that the art which created
the glorious abbeys and minsters, the
beautiful parish churches so plentifully
dotted over our country&mdash;abbeys, minsters,
and churches which the churchmen of
the second half of the nineteenth century
so reverently and wisely restore and
seek to copy stone by stone, arch by
arch, window by window, down to the
smallest bit of ornament&mdash;is a lost art!
Men have come sorrowfully to see that
mediæval architecture is the last link&mdash;perhaps
the most beautiful as well as the
last link&mdash;of that long chain of architectural
styles, 'commencing in far-back ages in
Egypt and passing on in continuous
course through Assyria, Persia, Greece,
Rome, and Byzantium, and thence taken
up by the infant nations of modern
Europe, and by them prolonged through
successive ages of continuous progress till
it terminated in the beautiful thirteenth-and
fourteenth-century Gothic, and has
never since produced a link of its own....
Alas! it is the last link of that
mighty chain which had stretched unbroken
through nearly four thousand years&mdash;the
glorious termination of the history of
original and genuine architecture.'" Well
may men love it and seek to preserve the
examples they possess of it, and aim at
copying it as well as they can. These
remarkable and melancholy words above
quoted were deliberately spoken by Sir
Gilbert Scott, R.A., LL.D., in his first lecture
on Mediæval Architecture delivered
at the Royal Academy some years ago.</p>

<p>So much for my note of sadness. Now
let me strike a different chord.</p>

<p>Such a gathering as the present, I repeat,
is an inspiring one, for it tells me that
if one great art dies, He who loves us
and has redeemed us at so great a price,
gives His children something in its place.
Now it is strange that amidst all the
gorgeous and striking ceremonial of the
mediæval services, with their wealth of
colour and ornament, with all their touching
and elaborate symbolism, music, as
it is now understood, was unknown and
comparatively neglected. In the noblest
cathedral of the Middle Ages, in the
stateliest Benedictine or Cistercian abbey,
while the eye was filled with sights of
solemnity and beauty, each sight containing
its special and peculiar teaching,
the ear was comparatively uncared for.
Strangely monotonous and even harsh
would chaunt and psalm and hymn, as
rendered in the mighty abbeys of Westminster,
Durham, or Gloucester in the
days of the great Plantagenets, of the
White Rose or Red Rose kings, sound
to the musically trained ears of the worshippers
of the second half of the nineteenth
century. Indeed, music as a great
science was unknown in pre-Reformation
times. The most complete anthem-book
may be searched through by the curious
scholar, but scarcely a musical composer
of any note will be found in these
collections of a date earlier than the reign
of Queen Elizabeth. It would seem as
though, when architecture ceased in the
sixteenth century to be a living craft,
a new art was discovered and worked at
by men.</p>

<p>A new art! I say these words, strange to
some, with emphasis. One who has indeed
a right to speak of music<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> thus voices my
assertion. While telling us that certain
grand forms of music loom out of the
darkness of the earlier centuries of our
era, the famous musician to whom I refer
adds that little of what we understand of
music existed before the later years of the
fifteenth century. It was no mere renaissance,
for that which had never been born
could not be born again.</p>

Music," delivered at the Royal Institution of Great Britain,
published 1884. See, too, Professor Hullah's Royal Institution
Lecture on the Transition Period of Musical History (1876).</p></div>

<p>In case some should think that too
strong expressions are here used, it may
be well to quote some of Professor
Hullah's own words, which he used in
the above-mentioned lecture at the Royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Institution:&mdash;"Music is a new art....
What we now call music ... what
answers to our definition of music, has
come into being only within comparatively
few years; almost within the
memory of men living." "I should say
that in the scholastic music there was no
art, and in the popular music no science;
whence it is that the former has ceased to
please, and the latter has for the most
part perished utterly."</p>

<p>It was a new art which charmed and
delighted men as they listened to the
magic of the sounds evoked by the majesty
of the compositions of Palestrina, or by
the sweetness of the music of Marenzio.
It is true, as I said, that certain grand
forms of music loom out of the darkness
of the remote past&mdash;shadowy forms&mdash;and
the rare composers and writers of the
music of the past are, as far as music is
concerned, but the shadow of names now.
I allude, as famous examples of these
shadows of names, to names such as
Gregory and Isidore, Hucbald and the
eleventh-century <em>maestro</em>, Guido Aretino.</p>

<p>With extraordinary rapidity developed
the new craft. To give here some familiar
landmarks&mdash;</p>

<p>Henry VIII. was reigning before Josquin
Deprès, whom all musicians revere as one
of the earliest, certainly the most renowned,
of the pioneers of modern music,
became generally known in Europe.
Josquin Deprès was born somewhere
about the year 1466, dying about 1515,
some ten or fifteen years before Palestrina
was born. Luther said of him, "Other
musicians do what they can with notes;
Josquin does what he likes with them."
The Abbate Baini alludes to him as "the
idol of Europe"; and again writes,
"Nothing is beautiful unless it be the
work of Josquin."</p>

<p>The famous Roman School of music only
dates from 1540. The oratorio, even in its
more simple forms, made its appearance
some seventy years later.</p>

<p>Not until the last years of our Queen
Elizabeth were the names of Palestrina
and Marenzio, those great early composers,
conspicuous, and the Queen so loved of
Englishmen had long fallen asleep before
Carissimi, the earliest master of the
sacred cantata in its many forms, gave
his mighty impulse to the new-born art;
while the works of his world-famed pupil
Scarlatti, and of our own English Purcell,
belong to the art-records of the days of
William and Mary and Queen Anne. See
how the whole of the marvellous story of
music&mdash;as we understand music&mdash;belongs
to quite recent days!</p>

<p>All through the eighteenth century,
when the Georges reigned, architecture
slept its well-nigh dreamless sleep. But
the new art of music grew with each
succeeding year, while the men whose
names will never die lived and wrote.</p>

<p>It was this eighteenth century which
saw a Beethoven, a Handel, a Bach, a
Haydn, and a Mozart. As masters of the
new-born craft none can be conceived
greater.</p>

<p>The century now closing boasts, however,
a long line of true followers and
worthy disciples of those great ones, men
whose names are household words in
every European city.</p>

<p>But my brief record, necessarily dry and
bald, of a momentous change in the teaching
of the world would be incomplete
without one word on the glorious instrument&mdash;the
voice, so to speak&mdash;of these
masters of a new art, the organ. The
first organ known in Western Europe
traditionally was sent to Pepin in France
by the Emperor of Constantinople in
759, but Aldhelm, Bishop of Sherborne,
in his poem on Virginity, some half a
century earlier, apparently describes
what appears to have been the organ.
Elphege, Abbot of Winchester in the tenth
century, is said to have caused a very
large organ to be constructed; but, with
this solitary exception, all the mediæval
organs seem to have been small and comparatively
unimportant instruments. The
oldest organ-cases preserved do not date
back further than the last years of the
fifteenth century, and these by the side
of modern organs are insignificant in size.
Viollet le Duc, in his great work, gives
us a picture of the Perpignan organ, one
of the earliest (early in the sixteenth
century). From this date the size rapidly
increased.</p>

<p>In the "Rites of Durham," where a
great mediæval church is described at the
period of the Dissolution (1530-40), there
were three organs in use in the abbey
church, the principal one being only used
at "principall Feasts," the pipes being
"very faire and partly gilded." "Only
two organs in England," says the "Rites,"
"of the same makinge, one in Yorke and
another in Paules."</p>

</div>

<p>The most magnificent organ-case in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">&nbsp;</a><br /><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Europe is the one in St. Janskirk at Bois
le Duc, and, like the vast majority of the
great organ-cases, is Renaissance in style.
Viollet le Duc sums up the question in the
following sentence:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It does not appear that great organs
were in use before the fifteenth century,
and it was only towards the close of the
fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth
centuries that the idea of building organs
of dimensions hitherto unknown was first
conceived."</p>

<p>The organ, as we now know it, was born
among us at the same date when architecture
died. Like the music of the Middle
Ages, in the days when these vast and
peerless buildings arose, it is true the
organ was not unknown; but, like
mediæval music, it was a small, poor
thing compared with the stupendous
instrument we know and love. There
was no great organ before the last
years of the fifteenth century, when the
Tudors reigned. The sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries witnessed its development,
and acknowledged its surpassing
grandeur, and recognised its fitness as
one of the chief handmaids of the new
great art.</p>

<p>Now the secret of the men who built
this lordly abbey is lost; never again
will such a triumph of, alas! a dead
art arise to charm and to delight, to
instruct and inspire the children of men.
But we may still preserve and reverently
use this rare and noble legacy of a
vanished age as a shrine and a peerless
teaching-home&mdash;a prayer-home, in which
are taught the great evangelical truths
by which Christian men live and breathe
and have their being, the saving knowledge
of the work of the Precious Blood,
the glad Redemption-story, the story loved
of men; the story which never ages, never
palls, but which, like dew, descends on
each succeeding generation of believers,
and gives them new stores of faith and
hope and love. This&mdash;these things&mdash;we try
to do, and not without success, for as God's
bright glory-cloud once brooded over the
sacred desert-tent and the holy Jerusalem
Temple, so now upon our beloved and
ancient cathedral, with its almost countless
services of praise and prayer and
teaching, God's blessing surely rests.</p>

<p>"It sleeps," does our cathedral, as one
has lately said in words beautiful as true&mdash;"it
sleeps with its splendid dreams upon
its lifted face." But it has, too, its many
wakeful working hours. Not the least
memorable of these will strike this week,
when the charmed strains of Handel and
Haydn, Mozart, Mendelssohn, and Beethoven,
and of the great Englishmen,
Gibbons and Boyce and Walmisley and
Wesley, and last, but not least, of Hubert
Parry, peal through these fretted vaults,
"lingering and wandering on" among these
wondrous chambers of inspired imagery;
while the almost prophetic words of that
truest English song-man Wordsworth
become history:&mdash;</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">A Hero in Disguise</span></h2>

<h3>A Complete Story. By M. Westrup.</h3>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/img136b.jpg" alt="The" width="100" height="99" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_1">T girl was little,
slender, insignificant&mdash;only
her
love made her
heroic. The man
was big, broad,
one to be noticed
in a crowd, and
his love made
him as helpless
as a little child.</p>
</div>

<p>They stood opposite each other in the
poor, shabby little room. His eyes
devoured her face wildly, incredulously,
but her eyes were fixed on a great
hole in the faded carpet.</p>

<p>Her mind was chaotic, for with his
eager words of love rang others, bewildering
her. Side by side with his
passionate outpouring of his love for her,
his longing to have her for his own, to
live for her and work for her, were
other words&mdash;words of ambition and
great aspirations, words of intending
travel into far-away countries, of hardships
and discomforts to be borne for the
sake of the book that was to be written&mdash;the
book that was to bring fame and
satisfaction to the writer of it.</p>

<p>And these words rang with a deep
note of earnestness and strength, and
overpowered those eager, present tones
that were pleading to her so wildly.</p>

<p>"I called you Kathleen Mavourneen
last night, you remember, and you
smiled and blushed!" he protested,
roughly. "Why did you do it? Kathleen,
you <em>do</em> love me, you do! Why
don't you speak to me? I tell you, I
have seen it in your eyes. Why do you
deny it now?"</p>

<p>She shook her head, and her heart
cried in agony, "How long? How long?"</p>

<p>"Won't you try, then?" with a
humbleness that was not natural to
him. "Oh, Kitty, little Kitty, I cannot
live without you!"</p>

<p>He held out his arms to her despairingly.</p>

<p>"I have a singing lesson to give at one
o'clock," she said.</p>

<p>His arms fell to his sides. The sun
streamed in on to the pretty, pale,
downbent face of the girl, and on to
the white, haggard face of the man
who stood opposite.</p>

<p>There were no shadows in the little
room&mdash;it was all glare and shabbiness.</p>

<p>"I will go," he said, and then his
eyes caught fire; "but you are a flirt!
Do you hear, a paltry, heartless flirt!
You have led me on&mdash;played with me.
You have made your eyes soft, your lips
sweet, to amuse yourself at my expense!
How do you do it?" with a little cynical
laugh. "It's really clever&mdash;of its kind&mdash;you
know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He moved towards the door.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he said icily.
"I should not have spoken so to a
woman. Good-bye."</p>

<p>"You will begin your travels now?"
she said.</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>"Why keep up the pretence?" he said;
"it's rather late now to pretend any
interest in my life."</p>

<p>She was silent.</p>

<p>At the door he paused.</p>

<p>He was a proud man, and he had an
iron will.</p>

<p>But his love made him helpless and
weak as a little child.</p>

<p>"Kathleen," he breathed, "you are
sure?"</p>

<p>A moment she stood still and rigid
as a statue.</p>

<p>"Little one, I love you so&mdash;&mdash;" His
voice was soft and caressing; but her
love made her heroic. She raised her
head. "I am sure," she said steadily.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The girl sat in a corner of the warm,
gorgeous drawing-room, and wished
vaguely that people would not nod and
stare at her so energetically. She was
used to it now, and tired of it.</p>

<p>She had never liked it, but fame
brings notoriety in its train, and
notoriety brings nods and whispers and
stares.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>She was dressed beautifully. She had
always liked pretty things, and now
she could have as many as she wanted.</p>

<p>The man stood over in a doorway
and watched her with cynical eyes.</p>

<p>He had not seen her for five years,
and as he stood there another man
lounged up and spoke to him.</p>

<p>"Looking at <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la belle Philomèle</i>?" he
said; "she's quite the rage, you know.
Ever heard her sing? You're only just
back from the wilds, aren't you? Oh,
well, of course you'll go to St. James's
Hall to-morrow? She's going to sing,
you know. Her voice is splendid. I
never go to hear her myself&mdash;makes me
feel I'm a miserable sinner somehow&mdash;does,
'pon my word. I've heard her
twice, and then I dropped it. Don't like
feeling small, you know."</p>

<p>He lounged away again, and the man
with the cynical eyes still watched her.</p>

<p>Her head was turned away from him&mdash;only
a soft, fair cheek and little ear
nestling in a soft mass of hair, a white
throat, and a lot of pale chiffon and silk,
could he see. And suddenly the cheek
and even neck were flooded with a red
blush, and then they looked whiter than
before. He wondered, and smiled bitterly
as he did so.</p>

<p>And the girl's eyes remained fixed,
eager, fascinated, on the long looking-glass
before her.</p>

<p>But she was not looking at herself.</p>

<p>Afterwards he sought her.</p>

<p>"You were wise," he said mockingly,
and her eyes grew dark with pain.</p>

<p>He took the seat beside her and played
with the costly fan he had picked up.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center">"You were wise," he said, mockingly.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>"I must congratulate you," he said
indifferently. "This"&mdash;with a comprehensive
wave towards her dress and the
diamonds at her throat&mdash;"is better than
the old days."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But perhaps you have forgotten so
long as&mdash;what is it?&mdash;ten&mdash;no, five years
ago?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>He furled and unfurled the fan in
silence, and wondered who had given
her the Parma violets in her hair.</p>

<p>"Your&mdash;book?" she said timidly.</p>

<p>He stared at her blankly.</p>

<p>She reddened slowly.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you&mdash;were going to&mdash;to travel,
and write about it&mdash;strange places&mdash;&mdash;"
she faltered.</p>

<p>"Oh, ah! yes, I believe I was&mdash;five
years ago."</p>

<p>Her face was white again now.</p>

<p>"You <em>have</em> travelled?" she ventured
at last.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! I've done nothing else for
five years. I've shot tigers, bears&mdash;I've
lived with Chinamen and negroes&mdash;chummed
with cannibals once&mdash;oh!"&mdash;with
a laugh&mdash;"I've had a fine time!"</p>

<p>Her eyes were wistful.</p>

<p>Her hostess brought up a man to be
introduced, and when she turned again,
the chair was empty.</p>

<p>She did not see him again for two weeks.</p>

<p>There was an added pathos in the
beautiful voice.</p>

<p><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La belle Philomèle</i> brought tears to
many thousands of eyes, but her own
were dry and restless. It was dawning
on her that she had made a mistake&mdash;five
years ago.</p>

<p>"Seen Hugh Hawksleigh?" she heard
one man say to another. "Never been
so disappointed in a chap in my life.
Years ago he promised great things.
Those articles of his on 'Foreign Ways
and Doings' made quite a sensation, you
know. And there was some talk of wild
travels and a book that was going to
be <em>the</em> book of the day. The travels are
all right, but where's the book?"</p>

<p>"The usual thing&mdash;a woman," drawled
the other. "Didn't you know? Some
pretty coquette&mdash;the usual game&mdash;but the
cost was heavier than usual&mdash;to him. It
knocked it out of him, you know. I
never saw a fellow so hard hit. That
was five years ago, and he's never written
a line since. Poor fellow!"</p>

<p>The knowledge that she had made a
mistake five years ago was growing
plainer to her.</p>

<p>At the end of the fortnight she met
him and asked him to come and see her.</p>

<p>He smiled, and did not come.</p>

<p>Her eyes grew too big for the small,
sad face.</p>

<p>She met him again, and asked him
why he had not come.</p>

<p>He looked down into the sweet, true
eyes, and his love weakened his will
again.</p>

<p>He promised he would come. He came,
and stayed five minutes. He looked
at her sternly as he greeted her.</p>

<p>"Why do you want me?" he said, and
watched the colour come and go in her
cheeks with pitiless eyes.</p>

<p>"We&mdash;used&mdash;to be&mdash;friends," she whispered.</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>"Never! I never felt friendship for
you," he said, "nor you for me. You
forget. Five years is a long time, but I
have a retentive memory. I forget
nothing."</p>

<p>"Nor I," she murmured.</p>

<p>"No? Then why do you ask me to
come and see you?"</p>

<p>She did not answer.</p>

<p>He looked round the pretty shaded
room.</p>

<p>He laughed again.</p>

<p>"There is a difference," he said, "in
you too."</p>

<p>She looked up quickly.</p>

<p>"I am the same," she said, knowing
her own heart.</p>

<p>"Are you?" His eyes grew stormy.
"Listen," he said, in a low, tense voice:
"I am five years wiser than I was&mdash;then.
I will not be a tool again. You
have ruined my life&mdash;doesn't that content
you? I would have staked my
life on your goodness and purity&mdash;once.
I dare not believe in any woman since
you, with your angel's eyes, are false. I
was full of ambition and hope once;
you killed both. I tried to write&mdash;after.
I could not. I shall never do anything
now&mdash;never be anything. I despise myself,
and it's not a nice feeling to live
with. It makes men desperate. I love
you still. Do you understand? I have
loved you all the time, and I loathe myself
for it." His voice changed. "You
may triumph," he said, "but now you
understand&mdash;I will not come again."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>She stretched out her arms after him,
but he was gone. And she knew now
quite clearly that she had made a mistake
five years ago.</p>

<p>For three weeks and a half she did
not see him.</p>

<p>Then she saw him when he thought
he was alone.</p>

<p>She studied his face with eyes that
ached at what they saw. Then she
went forward and touched him gently
on his arm.</p>

<p>"Well?" he said.</p>

<p>"Will you come," she said in a low
voice, "to see me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thanks, no."</p>

<p>His eyes rested bitterly on her rich
gown.</p>

<p>It came across him again how wise
she had been. Tied to him, she could
not have been as she was now.</p>

<p>"I have something I must say to
you," she said tremulously; "will you
come&mdash;just this once?"</p>

<p>He looked down into the soft eyes
with the beautiful light in them.</p>

<p>"I would rather not," he said gently.</p>

<p>The weariness in his eyes brought a
sob to her throat.</p>

<p>"Ah, do!" she entreated; "I will never
ask you again."</p>

<p>He looked at her with searching
incredulity.</p>

<p>Then he turned away.</p>

<p>Just so had she looked five years ago.</p>

<p>She laid a small, despairing hand on
his.</p>

<p>The iciness of it went to his heart.</p>

<p>"I will come," he said gently, and went
away.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When he came, he wondered at the
agitation in her small white face.</p>

<p>Her eyes were burning.</p>

<p>He waited silently.</p>

<p>She twisted her hands restlessly together,
and he saw that she was trembling.</p>

<p>He drew a chair forward.</p>

<p>"Won't you sit down?" he said.</p>

<p>She sat down in a nest of softest
cushions.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;" she began, and put up her
hand to her throat, "I want to&mdash;to&mdash;to
explain."</p>

<p>His face darkened.</p>

<p>She got up restlessly and faced him.</p>

<p>He thought of that time when they had
faced each other before&mdash;in the shabby,
glaring little room&mdash;and his face hardened.</p>

<p>"When you&mdash;&mdash;" she began; "I thought
it was for you&mdash;I had heard you say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are you going back five years?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then would you mind <em>not</em>?" he said.
"There can be no good in it, and to me
at least it is not a pleasant subject."</p>

<p>"I must!" she burst out. "Oh! cannot
you help me? It is so hard!"</p>

<p>She held out her hands pathetically.</p>

<p>A deep colour came into his tanned
face, and he stood still, looking at her
strangely.</p>

<p>"I think I will go," he said; "there is
no use in prolonging this."</p>

<p>"Do you&mdash;love&mdash;me still?" she cried
suddenly.</p>

<p>He turned on her in a white passion of
anger.</p>

<p>"Not content yet?" he breathed.
"What are you made of? Do you want
me to show you all my degradation?
Why? Oh, Kitty, Kitty, be merciful!
Be true to those eyes of yours&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped abruptly and moved over
to the door.</p>

<p>"Hugh, I love you!"</p>

<p>It was the veriest whisper, but it stayed
his steps, and brought a great light leaping
to his eyes.</p>

<p>The light died down.</p>

<p>"It is too late!" he said, and turned
away.</p>

<p>"Hugh, listen&mdash;I loved you always&mdash;five
years ago. It was for your sake&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He turned again.</p>

<p>"Kitty?" he said uncertainly.</p>

<p>She went on bravely, always heroic
through her love.</p>

<p>"I was poor&mdash;insignificant; you were
ambitious&mdash;clever. I had heard your
longings after greatness. Hugh, how
could you travel into those wild countries
with me? I knew you would give
it up, and how could I bear that? To
be a drag, a hindrance to you! And
in the coming years I thought you
would regret&mdash;&mdash; Hugh, you were poor,
too, though not so poor as I. I did it
for you&mdash;it nearly killed me, Hugh. I
was ill after, but it was for you!"</p>

<p>Her voice died away into silence.</p>

<p>He stood very still, and his face was
white and bloodless.</p>

<p>But in his eyes there was a great
reverence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>"Forgive me!" he said.</p>

<p>She smiled softly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she said.</p>

<p>The cynicism had gone from his face,
and the hardness and bitterness too.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/img140.jpg" width="450" height="519" alt="help" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"Oh, cannot you help me? It is so hard!"</p></div>
</div>

<p>She looked at him wistfully. He turned
away from her eyes and hid his face in
his hands.</p>

<p>"It was a mistake," he said, slowly,
dully.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Still she waited.</p>

<p>He looked up, and she strove to read
his face in vain.</p>

<p>Sad it was, and set, and yet there was
a light there too.</p>

<p>He took her hands gently in his.</p>

<p>"Kathleen," he said earnestly, "God
knows what I think of you. I can work
now. Good-bye, dear."</p>

<p>She raised her eyes to his&mdash;mystified
and anxious.</p>

<p>He answered them, very gently, but
with a firmness there was no gainsaying.</p>

<p>"You are famous," he said; "when I
have made a name I will come to you.
Will you wait, Kitty?"</p>

<p>"For ever, Hugh," she answered, understanding
him so well that that was
all she said.</p>

<p>He bent and kissed her hands.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>She knelt at the side of his bed, heedless
of the presence of the nurse at the
other end of the room, and her tears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
wetted his hand. The right hand and
arm were swathed in bandages.</p>

<p>He smiled sadly as he looked at her.</p>

<p>"I am a failure," he said.</p>

<p>"Ah, no, no! All England is ringing
with your name. Hugh"&mdash;she raised a
face all alight with a proud joy&mdash;"you
are famous now!"</p>

<p>A little flush rose to his white face.</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" he said, "rescuing a woman
and a few children from being burnt to
death. Anyone would have done it."</p>

<p>"Ah, no, Hugh! Brave men shrank
from that awful sea and burning
ship!"</p>

<p>He was silent, looking at his bandaged
hand.</p>

<p>"I must learn to write with my left
hand," he said.</p>

<p>She bent nearer.</p>

<p>"Let me write for you," she whispered;
"let me finish your book, Hugh, while
you dictate it to me. I do not sing now
in public, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know."</p>

<p>He drew her closer to him and rested
his cheek against her soft hair.</p>

<p>"I said I would not come to you till I
had made a name," he said. "I am a
wreck now! I shall be a wreck for a
long while&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, dear, but you are famous!" she
interposed lovingly.</p>

<p>He sighed.</p>

<p>"I cannot do without you any longer,
Kitty. I am beaten at last. Will you
take a wreck?"</p>

<p>"I will take <em>you</em>, Hugh, a famous&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A famous wreck," he finished with a
smile.</p>

<h2> THE PULPIT MANNER</h2>

<h3>CHARACTERISTIC GESTURES OF GREAT PREACHERS.</h3>

<p class="center">By F. M. Holmes.</p>


<p>First let us look at Dr. Joseph
Parker. His sermons are constantly
attended by ministers
of all denominations, including
clergymen of the Church of
England; and no stronger testimony, we
take it, could be given to a man's extraordinary
preaching power than that
year after year he continually attracts
other preachers.</p>

<p>Dr. Parker, it is almost needless to
explain, is the eminent Congregational
minister of the City Temple in London,
and he occupies the unique position of
having maintained for thirty years a
noonday service every Thursday in addition
to his usual Sunday services. To this
Thursday service come persons from the
ends of the earth, and ministers and
laymen of various religious
persuasions. On one occasion
the sittings of a conference
belonging to one of the minor
Methodist bodies seemed seriously
imperilled because so many of the
delegates desired to go and hear Dr.
Parker.</p>

<p>What is the secret of his widely attractive
power? The answer comes in a word&mdash;he
is intensely dramatic. We do not
mean theatrical. He chooses a clear
message to deliver, and that message&mdash;that
paramount thought&mdash;is driven home
to his hearers in a manner that forces
itself upon every mind, no matter how
reluctant. He uses short, pithy sentences,
and heightens and emphasises their effect
by suitable modulations of voice, by
deliberate or rapid utterance as the words
may require, and by vigorous and appropriate
gesture. He speaks only the very
pith and point of what he has to say,
and then says it in the clearest and most
suitably effective manner that he can
possibly command. It is the thing itself
we hear, rather than talk or argument all
round and about it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/img142b.jpg" width="350" height="351" alt="Parker" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">DR. PARKER.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Thus, on one occasion, his theme was
found in the text, "Jesus in the midst."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
"Where is the midst?" he asked in a
clear and striking, sonorous voice that
commanded attention at once. These
were his opening words, and after a
pause he proceeded
in the same manner
and in similar short,
striking sentences to
point to different
ideas of "the midst,"
and to declare that
Christ was, or should
be, in the midst of
the literature, science,
philosophy, and business
of the day. Unless
ministers
preached Christ, said he, they had better
be silent.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/img143.jpg" width="450" height="545" alt="bishops" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">BISHOP OF RIPON. ARCHDEACON SINCLAIR.

BISHOP OF STEPNEY.</p></div>
</div>

<p>There is nothing new in this, you will
say. No doubt Dr. Parker would tell you
that he does not wish to preach anything
new; but no one can watch him critically
without concluding that he constantly
studies not only what he shall say, but
how he shall say it in the most striking
and effective manner.</p>



<p>As a dramatic
preacher, we might
also instance the Rev.
J. H. Jowett, who has
succeeded the late Dr. Dale at Carr's
Lane Congregational Church, Birmingham.
To his Oxford scholarship Mr.
Jowett has united an assiduous cultivation
of a fine voice and vigorous yet
graceful and suitable gesture, which render
him a most striking and fascinating
preacher.</p>

<p>But turning now to other styles, if Dr.
Parker is one of the most dramatic, Dr.
Boyd Carpenter, the learned Bishop of
Ripon, is one of the most eloquent of
preachers. He is also one of the most
rapid. He seems so fully charged with
his subject that the words pour from
his lips like a torrent; his body turns first
to one side and then to the other, and
anon leans forward in front, as though
propelled by the energy of the thought
within. His hand is often held up before
him with the index finger pointing, as
though to lead his audience on to the
next thought, and to prevent their interest
or attention from flagging. But,
rapid and fluent as he is, it must not
be thought that he is superficial; on
the contrary, there is every evidence that
the discourse is well thought out, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
based on a solid framework of reason,
while the language is eloquent and rhetorical.
And it is, as it were, to mark
the network of logical deduction within
the words that the index finger is brought
so fully into play. We judge that his
voice is naturally somewhat thin and poor,
but by careful use and perhaps assiduous
cultivation, and by the most beautifully
clear articulation, Dr. Boyd Carpenter
can make himself heard in St. Paul's with
what appears to be perfect ease. There
is no straining of the voice and no shouting;
but in a quiet though forcible
manner he sends his voice round the
huge building. Further, it has been
pointed out to me that he will not commence
his discourse until the congregation
have settled themselves down into absolute
quietness, and all the rustling of
dresses, and coughing, and fidgeting are
stilled. Under these circumstances his
voice would, of course, carry far better
in a large church.</p>

<p>Somewhat similar in manner is Canon
Barker, of Marylebone, who, in the
energetic expression of the thought with
which he seems surcharged, bends forward
sometimes so deeply towards the congregation
as to give, the impression that he
is about to dive out of the pulpit. But
his style is that of the special pleader,
the advocate and the debater; it is as
though he desires to argue out everything
to its logical conclusion, rather
than to sway or move his audience by
eloquence and emotional appeals.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/img144a.jpg" width="350" height="401" alt="Webb" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">PREBENDARY WEBB-PEPLOE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Dean Lefroy of Norwich is also a
debater; perhaps, a more keen debater
than Canon Barker, and he is also a
rhetorician. He delights to preach
a strongly evangelical "Gospel" sermon,
and to embellish it with
rhetoric and declaim it with passionate
earnestness. It is evident
he thoroughly believes in his theme,
he seeks to impress it on his audience
by vigorous, earnest, passionate
utterance, in which his energetic gestures
are often of the most decided
character. A curious characteristic of
his preaching has been related to me
by a friend. "You cannot listen to
Lefroy for five minutes," said he, "without
violently taking sides either for or
against him. You are either intensely
in favour of him or find yourself becoming
almost vehemently opposed"&mdash;a
testimony, we take it that the Dean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
is a decided, downright, assertive and aggressive
preacher rather than persuasive
and emotional. He has instituted a Nave
service at Norwich Cathedral, at which
he often preaches himself, and attracts
enormous congregations.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/img144b.jpg" width="250" height="348" alt="McNeil" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">JOHN MCNEIL.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Still continuing to glance at those whom
we may call rapid and fluent preachers,
Prebendary Webb-Peploe comes to mind.
He is not so energetic as some others,
but the rapidity of his utterance, the
fluency of his expression, and his great
command of language, would rival that
of almost any speaker. He and many
others would probably utter three times
as many words in a given time as Dr.
Parker or Archdeacon Sinclair.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/img145a.jpg" width="350" height="267" alt="MACLAREN" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">IAN MACLAREN</p>

<p class="center">(<em>Dr. John Watson.</em>)</p></div>
</div>

<p>The latter is slow, deliberate, and dignified
in his utterances, rarely using gesture
and affecting a grave and somewhat
sonorous voice; but the Archdeacon's
sermons are always most carefully prepared,
and indicate considerable study
and research.</p>

<p>Among the grave and sedate preachers
we might also place Dr. John Watson
("Ian Maclaren"), of Sefton Park Presbyterian
Church, Liverpool; his sermons
are full of thought, and, as might be
expected, exhibit an excellent literary
finish.</p>

<p>Now, if we take Archdeacon Sinclair
and Dr. John Watson as examples of more
deliberate and sedate preachers, we may
regard the Rev. John McNeil, the well-known
Presbyterian minister, as an
instance of the colloquial preacher.</p>

<p>Not that his voice is low-pitched, as used
in conversation. Mr. McNeil has done
what few preachers could physically undertake:
he has preached twice
a day for a fortnight in the
Albert Hall at Kensington,
the largest hall in London,
and capable of holding about
ten thousand persons; and
he has repeatedly filled the
huge Agricultural Hall at
Islington, numbers being
turned away from lack of room. His voice,
indeed, seems capable of filling the largest
hall without effort. But his style is easy,
unaffected, conversational, though sometimes,
with both arms outstretched, he
bursts forth into loud and impassioned
appeals. There is no doubt a large section
of the public who like this easy and
colloquial style, especially if it come quite
naturally to the speaker.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">DR. MCLAREN.</p></div>
</div>

<p>And now another celebrated figure rises
on the scene, the eminent Baptist minister,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Dr. McLaren of Manchester. Refined,
scholarly, brimming over with knowledge,
and a master of beautiful illustration,
there is no doubt that he takes rank as
one of the very greatest preachers of the
day. Like other great speakers, he has
evidently studied the art of preaching.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/img146.jpg" width="450" height="449" alt="Horton and others" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">DR. HORTON. HUGH PRICE HUGHES. J. R. JOWETT.
SILVESTER HORNE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>At a meeting at
the Holborn Restaurant
to celebrate his
ministerial jubilee in
April, 1896, he said he had determined,
at the outset of his
career, to concentrate his mind
on the work of the ministry
and not fritter away his
energies over many minor engagements.
He had always
endeavoured to make his ministry
one of Gospel exposition;
he had preached Christ
because he believed that men
needed redemption, and he
had preached without doubts
and hesitations. It was
Thomas Binney who had taught him
how to preach.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly Dr. McLaren has succeeded
in his aim as an expositor of the Scriptures,
for that is regarded as one of his
chief characteristics. A favourite gesture
of Dr. McLaren's&mdash;at all events in his
earlier days&mdash;was to squeeze up a handkerchief,
no doubt quite unconsciously, in
his right hand by the nervous energy he
was putting forth in his discourse, and
then suddenly his hand would dart out to
mark some emphatic passage as though
he were about to throw the handkerchief
at the congregation; but needless to
add the handkerchief was never thrown.</p>

<p>Like Dr. McLaren, Dr. Whyte, of Free
St. George's, Edinburgh, has a great command
of beautiful and striking illustrations.
"He is the most wonderful preacher
in Scotland," declared an enthusiastic Scot
to me on one occasion. "Mr. Gladstone
used often to hear him, and Lord Rosebery
does now." Dr. Whyte makes
great use of the imagination in his discourses
and employs frequent gestures,
but graceful, emphatic
and always
to suit the action to
the word and the
word to the action.
"One illustration,"
said a gentleman,
"I remember some
time ago. Dr. Whyte
was preaching
about tribulation, and he showed that the
word came from <em>tribulum</em>, which is a Latin
name for a roller or sledge for thrashing
out corn, and in the same way tribulation
sifted men as wheat." How like a platitude
this may sound when summarised
down to a line; but the point is that the
idea of the beneficial purpose of tribulation
had been so firmly fixed in the
hearer's mind that he remembered it,
and perchance in some dark hour it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
had been to him a "cup of strength in
some great agony." Is not that, after
all, one of the great aims and one of the
great tests of good speaking&mdash;to fix some
idea, some truth firmly in the hearer's
mind so that it is never forgotten?</p>

<p>As a robust, manly preacher few, if any,
we suspect, can surpass Dean Hole of
Rochester. He has a tall, commanding presence&mdash;he
is over six feet high&mdash;a bright,
animated countenance, and a most genial
manner. When some years ago he held
the living of Caunton, Notts, he used to
journey periodically to Liverpool, where
his midday addresses to commercial men
were most successful and exercised great
influence. He does not employ much gesture,
but his fine voice, sparkling eye
and manly, straightforward utterances,
based on reason and logic, always command
deep attention.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">DR. WHYTE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>His appeal is rather to reason than to
the emotions, and by way of contrast
we may glance at Canon Wilberforce,
who is fluent and fervent, and affords
one of the best examples of the emotional
preacher. It would seem as though he
set himself to arouse and stir up all the
feelings of his congregation and lead
them into what he conceives to be the
right channel. Often choosing most unusual
texts, he can yet make direct and
pointed appeals from the pulpit, touching
the greatest hopes and deepest trusts of
human nature, and yet can employ as
illustrations the greatest events and the
newest discoveries of the day. He uses
but little gesture, in this respect being
somewhat different from the eminent
Wesleyan, the Rev. Hugh Price Hughes,
who might also be classed as an emotional&mdash;we
had almost said passionate&mdash;preacher.
In fluency and fervour he is probably
surpassed by none. Possessed of a remarkably
clear, vibrating, and penetrating
voice, which seems as though it could
thrill through any building, however
large, there is no chance of anyone
dozing when he is in the pulpit. When
pleading some cause or denouncing some
wrong, his feelings seem to get the
better of him, and he slashes away
with his voice in a perfect hurricane of
verbal blows.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">DR. CLIFFORD.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Quite as emotional and quite as fluent
is Dr. Clifford of Westbourne Park Baptist
Church. His command of language is extraordinary,
and with a mind less clear
and well-regulated this great fluency
might prove a snare; but his discourses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
are always remarkably well-arranged, his
"points" are clear, and his meanings
driven home with remarkable emphasis.
His congregations are immense, and his
hearers are devoted to him. His gestures
often follow his words, and one&mdash;probably
quite unconscious&mdash;is, it must be
confessed, not graceful, even if forcible:
it is a drawing back of his arms, and
then shooting them out both together
as if appealing to the people. His voice
is exceptionally clear, penetrating, and
resonant; and in all
very popular preachers
much is due to
the voice.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">DEAN HOLE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Bishop of Stepney,
who may be
described as bearing
all the characteristics
of the highly cultured
Oxford man, has in
addition a deeply sympathetic
musical voice.
He does not use much
gesture, but such as
he does employ is well
suited to the words,
while his illustrations
are often drawn from
his social and religious
work in the East End. He used frequently
to preach in Victoria Park, where
he has readily acknowledged his best
supporters were Nonconformists.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center">CANON BARKER.<br />
CANON WILBERFORCE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Another eminent preacher whom we may
also describe as exhibiting all the characteristics
of Oxford culture is Dr. Horton
of Lyndhurst Road Congregational Church,
Hampstead. Possessed, like the Bishop
of Stepney, of a remarkably sympathetic
voice, he modulates and varies
it to suit the subject and the words,
and his gesture, never redundant, has
lately been reduced almost to extinction.
At the sermon which he preached before
the Congregational Union at its autumnal
assembly at Birmingham in 1897, his
style was almost severely quiet, but the
effect of his thrilling voice and sometimes
awesome whispered tones, his
polished literary language, and his
intense earnestness&mdash;as he declared that
the ideal Christian must be in constant
touch with God, and yet in constant
touch with men&mdash;was very great, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
appealed both to reason and emotion.
Indeed, both of these find their place
in his sermons. Dr. Horton has mastered
the art of always being interesting,
no matter what his theme; and it
would seem as though in his discourses
he makes an effort to really interest
and to reach all sorts and conditions of
men.</p>

<p>Another Congregational minister who
exhibits much of the Oxford manner is the
Rev. Silvester Horne, of Kensington; but,
in addition, he seems possessed of a fiery
zeal and fervent enthusiasm that will,
it is feared, wear him out physically before
his day is fully spent, unless he carefully
husbands his nervous energy. Already,
although a young man, he has had to
take rest for a whole year because of
ill-health. That inner fire, that mental
energy, that disciplined enthusiasm,
which light up his face so brilliantly
and animate his suitable and graceful
gesture, are far too precious a possession
to be quenched too quickly; but there
are few or none of the younger preachers
of the day who have promise of a more
brilliant future.</p>

<p>And now a word in conclusion for one
who is perhaps the greatest philosophical
preacher of the time&mdash;Dr. Fairbairn of
Mansfield College at Oxford. His memory
is marvellous, his power of choice and
accurate verbal expression is wonderful;
he can speak for hours without
a note, and though sometimes a sentence
should appear involved and complicated,
it will finish admirably, and,
if read in a verbatim report afterwards,
will have all the finish of a
literary production wrought out in the
quiet of the study. He uses but little
gesture, an occasional opening out of
hands and arms, as though to present
and lay before the audience the thought
which he is uttering, seems nearly all.
In fact, it would appear that he is so
absorbed in the abstract thought, the
argument, the philosophy he is working
out before you, that he thinks nothing
of the manner in which he utters it.</p>

<p>We do not pretend to have exhausted
the list of famous preachers, or even to
have glanced at all the different types;
but these will be sufficient to indicate
the variety that prevails, and to show
that there is an art of preaching which,
like other arts, needs to be assiduously
cultivated, and well repays those who
intelligently do so.</p>

<h2>ROGER PETTINGDALE</h2>

<h3><em>A RUSTIC LOVE-STORY.</em></h3>

<p class="center">By H. A. Davies.</p>


<p>Across the fields from the church&mdash;through
the clover
meadow first, into the
broad wheat-field next,
and thence over the pasture
lands, all yellow with
the glint of buttercups&mdash;you will come
to the Pettingdale farm. A thrill and
a song and an aching went through my
blood all together when I looked on the
block of buildings the other day. How
sweet-and-bitter is remembrance; how
musical to the heart, and yet how sad
with yearning! For the sight of that
rugged old chimney standing square and
grim and familiar upon the grey roof of
the house; the red-tiled barns clustering
behind, plain and prosperous; the sweep
of the waving corn-fields towards the
setting sun; caused my heart to surge
with swift memories, long since buried
and forgotten beneath the stress of
life. How peaceful were the old days
amidst these very fields! When the
heart is young, ah! then's the time for
music; and what echoes of far-off melodies&mdash;songs
of old summers past and gone&mdash;does
the scene awaken! There's the
orchard where I spent such rare hours.
Here are the hedges where we went
a-nutting. Yonder is the oak-tree which
we used to climb, Frank Pettingdale and
I. It is still the same sturdy tree, keeping
gnarled and knotted guard over the
same creaking gateway, just as in the
old days!</p>

<p>Wherever my eyes fell there were
thorns and roses for the heart all in one
moment. It was in the old upland field
that Clara Pettingdale and I as children
used to wander, hand in hand, amongst
the buttercups. She has long slept, poor
Clara, in that corner of the churchyard
where lie generations of Pettingdales
past and gone&mdash;a long line of sturdy
yeomen.</p>

<p>The full light of the sun falls upon
the courtyard of the farmhouse. It has
a broad frontage, long and low and quaint,
with irregular gables and overhanging
eaves and deep, mullioned windows. The
house runs queerly on two sides of the
courtyard, one wing being at right angles
to the other. It is beautifully clean and
prim, with its whitewashed walls, its
freshly painted woodwork, and its
geraniums growing in green boxes on
every window-sill. On the third side of
the yard run the granary and the cider-house;
while the fourth, save for an ivy-covered
wall, which gives way to the
entrance gates in one corner, is open to
the gentle vista of countryside which
stretches away before the house. What
a pleasant old courtyard it is&mdash;so cool in
the summer that the panting dogs love
to throw themselves upon its stones; so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
sheltered in winter that the blustering
nor'-easters touch it not; so prosperous-looking
always, with its well-kept flags
laid from end to end, as level and smooth
as a billiard-table, and as spotless as the
floor of the farm kitchen. How the
polished milk-cans glisten and blink upon
the wall! How the white sills of the
old-fashioned windows gleam in the sunlight!
The whole place seems to breathe
of scouring and buckets, and scrubbing
brushes and vigorous arms. Every morning
the yard is washed down by the house-boy
(it used to be Elijah in my day, but
he is now a bearded man, and labours
outside, and a young Ezra is the present
knight of the bucket); every morning the
cans are scoured and the tubs are
scrubbed, and the step before the door
is free-stoned, and the flowers are
watered, and the house seems to smile
a glistening, watery smile, as though it
had just lifted its head from its morning
dip to bid you the time of day. There
was ever a charm to me about Pettingdale
and its paved courtyard. I mind me
well what a brave and romantic sound
to my young ears was that of the horse's
hoofs ringing and clamping upon the
stones as he was brought up to the door
on market days with the high yellow
dogcart behind him; or the clatter of
the wheels across the yard as Roger
Pettingdale drove out through the broad
gateway, a fine old figure with his white
hair, and his aquiline nose, and his broad,
well-set shoulders.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/img151.jpg" width="450" height="328" alt="white hair" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">His hair went snow-white early in life.</p></div>
</div>

<p>He is still outwardly the same. One
could hardly detect a single point of
change in him, save that his face is
more furrowed and his eyes deeper set.
His hair went snow-white early in life.
Generations of Pettingdales have been
subject to the same peculiarity. Thus it is
that the long step from forty to sixty-five
has wrought little difference in Roger
Pettingdale. His body is as erect, his
step as firm, his voice as sonorous as ever.
He was ever a well-known figure at all
the county markets and agricultural meetings,
and it might be twenty-five years
agone for all the change that one can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
see in him. Among other men he was
always noticeable, with his tall figure, his
white hair, his clean-shaven, well-cut
face, and that wide-rimmed silk hat
which he always affected. As he moved
amongst the crowd I have heard men
say, "Who is that?" and others answer,
"Don't you know him? Why, surely
everybody knows <em>him</em>? He's Roger
Pettingdale."</p>

<p>He is elected on all the local bodies.
Thus he is a guardian of the poor, a
member of the School Board, vice-chairman
of the County Council, and
the people's churchwarden at the parish
church. There is no man amongst all
those he meets in these capacities
whose words are listened to with more
respect. That solid weight, that hallmark
of sound judgment which always
attends upon sheer common-sense, is
apparent in every opinion he utters.
He forms his judgments first, and speaks
afterwards. While other men are impulsively
throwing themselves into useless
controversy on this or that vexed
question, Roger Pettingdale is silently
weighing the <em>pros</em> and <em>cons</em> of the
matter in his own mind; and when he
speaks there is usually nothing more
to be said. He chops no logic; he
simply argues with the sledge-hammer
of common-sense, backed up by the
blunt, uncompromising sincerity of an
honest and fair-dealing mind. His
tolerance, his breadth of vision, his
power of seeing the other side of the
question, his scorn of all shams and
pretences, have made his name a password
for integrity and sound judgment.
"You will always get a fair hearing
from Roger Pettingdale," people say.
"Does Roger Pettingdale think so?
Oh, then, there must be something in
it."</p>

<p>In his home life, in the control of his
farm, in his own daily affairs, there is
the same straightforwardness, the same
sincerity, the same well-balanced judgment
and acumen. "There never was
a year, as I remember, when we didn't
have plenty of hay to begin conditioning
on," said one of his labourers the
other day. "Now, at the next farm
they've never got enough." That is
only a small instance of the perfection
of method which marks every department
of the prosperous farm.</p>

<p>At home he is essentially a plain
man, this sturdy farmer. There is no
nonsense about him, although he can
claim blood with one of the oldest
families in the county. Yet he has a
proper pride, in a manly, direct kind
of way, as you shall see. He has had
four children, two boys and two girls,
in giving birth to the youngest of
whom his wife died. James, the eldest,
is his right hand in the farm management,
and will some day be head of
the family, as the Pettingdales have
succeeded, son to father, for generations
out of mind. Mary, the second,
you shall hear more of anon. Frank,
the third, my old playmate, early in
life took the fancy that he would like
to be a soldier. Roger Pettingdale has
ever been a wise and a tolerant father,
studying well the nature of each of his
children. He unerringly knew Frank's
proud and stubborn character.</p>

<p>"You want to be a soldier?" he said.
"Well, I could have wished it otherwise,
Frank. It would have been a
pleasure to me to see you settle down
on the farm. But we will not argue
the point. Let it stand for twelve
months, and then talk to me about it."</p>

<p>Twelve months did not change Frank's
resolve. When he mentioned it again, a
drawn look passed over Roger Pettingdale's
face for a moment&mdash;a look of keen
pain&mdash;for he loved his children. Then he
drew himself up to his full height.</p>

<p>"You are still of the same mind,
Frank! Then I have nothing more to
say. I am not going to attempt to
dictate to you what your calling should
be. You have to live your own life,
and as you make your bed you must
lie on it. Remember that, my lad. If
you decide to go as a soldier, you
shall go in a proper fashion, lad. You
shall have your commission. No son of
mine shall enter the ranks."</p>

<p>And have his commission Frank did.
I looked at the tablet in the old
church the other day with a surging
heart. It is a brass tablet, the lettering
of which has been recently renovated.</p>

<p class="center">
<small>TO THE MEMORY OF<br />
LIEUTENANT FRANK PETTINGDALE,<br />
WHO FELL IN ACTION IN THE<br />
BATTLE OF TEL-EL-KEBIR.</small>
</p>

<p>That was all. There was no vainglorious
recounting of the brave deed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
performance of which Frank was cut
down. He fell "in action." That was
all. It was Roger Pettingdale all over&mdash;simple
and direct and manly. And
were not the laconic words far more
eloquent than all the ornate elegiacs
that poets might have written, just as
Roger Pettingdale's silent grief when
the news reached him was far more
eloquent than all the passionate outbursts
of frenzied sorrow that one
could conceive?</p>

<p>The fourth child, Clara, as I have already
said, sleeps in the churchyard.
She died when she was a fair-haired
girl of ten&mdash;as bright and promising a
maiden as one could wish to see. But
she was ever fragile, like her mother,
and suddenly she faded away, leaving a
great gap in the home life at the Pettingdale
farm.</p>

<p>As to Mary, the second child, she was
nineteen years of age, and newly returned
from school, when Edward Leigh, the
son of old Squire Leigh, of the Hall,
came home from his travels round
the world. These two, who had only
distantly known each other as children,
met for the first time after many years&mdash;she
a sweet-looking, fresh-coloured
girl, in the first blush of womanhood;
and he a manly, well-set young
fellow with a pleasant, sincere face and
straightforward blue eyes. It was the
old story! Twang goes the bow of the
roguish little archer, and to some heart
or another the world all at once becomes
rose-colour. The old story! They saw
each other on a Sunday morning across
the church. She, sitting in the Pettingdale
pew, mentally noted that there was
a young man at the Squire's side who
could be no other than his newly returned
son; and he, from his corner underneath
the dingy, ponderous coat-of-arms of the
Leigh family, looked upon her in her
simple dress of white. The sun, striking
through the window to her right, glinted
upon her brown hair, which always curled
so prettily about her forehead. He
thought, as he looked, that she was the
sweetest, daintiest maiden he had ever
seen, and he fell in love with her.</p>

<p>He made no secret of his passion. Beating
about the bush was entirely
foreign to Edward Leigh. The
choleric old Squire went off
into a fit of apoplectic rage
when he heard how things
stood. The veins swelled in
his forehead, and that pugnacious
under-lip of his stood
out and drew itself over the
upper lip and the teeth with
a tight grip. But Edward had
all the old Leigh blood in him.
"I love her, father," he said
quietly, looking the Squire
straight in the face, and the
old man's heart sank within
him as he met the steady
glance of those blue eyes.
Fits of passion, threats, fiery
denunciations&mdash;they were all
of no avail. Edward was
never once other than respectful.
He would stand with
shoulders squared and head
uplifted, bearing the storm in
perfect calm and silence, and
then would look his father in
the face and say&mdash;"Father, I
love her"; and the Squire
would clench his fist and march
to and fro, furiously stamping
his feet upon the floor.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/img153.jpg" width="350" height="409" alt="love" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"Father, I love her."</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>In one culminating fit of choleric rage
the Squire rode over to the farm. He
found Roger Pettingdale in the corn-field,
looking at the growing wheat.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/img154.jpg" width="450" height="531" alt="forgive" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"Forgive me!"</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Look here, Pettingdale," he burst
forth fiercely. "This nonsense must be
stopped. Are you an idiot, that you
cannot see what is going on, or are you
in the scheme to entrap my&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Roger Pettingdale turned round upon
him.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Squire Leigh?"
he said quietly, as one who had not
heard aright.</p>

<p>"Tut! Nonsense!" retorted the Squire.
"Don't 'beg-your-pardon' me! You
know full well what I mean. Are you
blind? I say it must be stopped! You
know full well that that precious son of
mine has gone stark mad over that chit
of a girl of yours!"</p>

<p>"And what of that, Squire Leigh?"
replied Roger Pettingdale, drawing himself
to his full height and looking at
the Squire from underneath his heavy
eyebrows. "If that precious son of yours
has gone stark mad over my daughter,
what of that?"</p>

<p>"Why, this," thundered the Squire:
"that it must be stopped!"</p>

<p>"Very well, why don't you stop it?"
replied Roger Pettingdale.</p>

<p>The retort, perfectly cool and natural,
laid bare all the Squire's impotence at
one stroke, and drove him well-nigh to
frenzy. His eyes shot fire, and those
veins in his forehead swelled as though
they would burst.</p>

<p>"It is not my daughter who is coming
to the Hall after your son," Roger Pettingdale
went on. "It is your son who
is coming here after my daughter. You
seem to forget that point. You say it
must be stopped. And I repeat&mdash;Why
don't you stop it?"</p>

<p>"It is as I thought," shouted the enraged
Squire. "You are all in it&mdash;all of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
you. All in the scheme to entrap him!
A pretty plot, don't you call it, for a
man who poses as a Christian?"</p>

<p>In a blind access of fury he took a step
forward and raised his riding-whip.
And then his shaking arm fell to his
side, for Roger Pettingdale had laid a
hand upon his shoulder, and was confronting
him with grave, kindly, pitying
eyes.</p>

<p>"You are in anger, Squire Leigh," he
said, with simple dignity, "else I should
take your words as an insult. Be sure
that the Pettingdales have not fallen
so low, nor their womenkind either,
that they need to trap the son of Squire
Leigh. But I tell you this, as man to
man: if your son truly loves my
daughter, and if she loves him in return,
I will put no bar before my child's
happiness; no, not for you, nor for all
the Leighs in the world. We come of
as good a stock as you, Squire! Remember
that! More money and more
land maybe you have&mdash;but not more
pride of family. I care naught for your
money or your land. Thank God! I have
prospered beyond all expectation. And
I tell you again, straight to your face,
if your son comes to me and asks for
my daughter's hand, and I find it is for
her happiness, I shall say 'Yes.'"</p>

<p>"I shall disinherit him!" burst forth
the Squire; "he shall not have a penny&mdash;not
a brass farthing!"</p>

<p>"I shall tell him," continued Roger Pettingdale,
"that if he would win my
daughter, he must first make a position
for himself in the world, independently
of aught you can do for or against him;
and that shall be the test of his sincerity."</p>

<p>Then he turned away, and the Squire,
his face livid with passion, marched off,
savagely cutting at the wheat-ears with
his riding-whip. And when he mounted
his horse at the corner of the field, he
dug his spurs so viciously into her that
she bounded and reared, and almost
threw him.</p>

<p>Well, the long and short of it was
that Edward Leigh was not found
wanting in the test which was imposed
upon him.</p>

<p>"You are quite right, sir," he said to
Roger Pettingdale; "the condition is
a reasonable one. I ask for nothing
more than the chance of proving that
I am in earnest."</p>

<p>He went to London, studied under his
father's old college friend, John
Wetherell, the well-known Queen's
Counsel, and in five years was making
fair headway in the courts as a barrister.
And the strange part of it was
that the choleric old Squire&mdash;who has a
good heart underneath his rough exterior&mdash;seeing
his son's name in the
papers from time to time, felt his
paternal pride rising within him despite
his stubborn resentment. Perhaps, too,
he felt lonely in his old age. At all
events, he went over to the farm one
day, and asked to see Mary.</p>

<p>"I shall fight against it no longer,
my dear," he said, holding out his hand.
"The lad has proved his grit, and the
woman who can call forth such steady
love in a man is more than worthy of
being mistress of the Hall. I am an old
man, and have no time left for bitternesses.
Forgive me, and you will find me
as staunch in friendship as you have
found me frank in enmity."</p>

<p>Mary is now Mary Leigh, of Leigh Hall,
and a sweeter, gentler, more winsome
mistress you could not find in the whole
land. You may often see the old Squire
leaning upon her shoulder&mdash;a bent, white-haired
figure&mdash;as they walk in the
grounds.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Among all the seasons of the year, I
think there is none that Roger Pettingdale
loves so well as the time of harvest.
You may see him standing at the gateway,
looking in meditation down the
long shimmer and sheen of the golden
wheat-field as the wind ripples over it.</p>

<p>"I love to gaze at fields white with
corn," he said to me once. "They seem
to breathe rich promises of that full
fruition to which our own lives shall
come if we live them well and uprightly."</p>

<p>At the last harvest thanksgiving service
in the village church I was present for
the sake of old times, and from my
place behind Roger Pettingdale I saw
him lost in meditation, with eyes fixed
upon the chancel window. And when he
stood up to sing he was still rapt in
thought; but suddenly he joined in the
sweet old hymn so lustily and with
such a full heart that it did me good
to hear him.</p>

<h2>THE ART OF READING.</h2>

<p class="center">By the Ven. Archdeacon Diggle, M.A.</p>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/img156a.jpg" alt="R" width="100" height="111" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_1">Reading aloud is more
commonly regarded as
an accomplishment
than an art. In truth,
it is both. It is an
art in that it cannot
be left to its own
guidance, but requires
both an acquaintance with rules and
familiarity with their practice to bring
it to perfection. It is an accomplishment
in that it is a means of completing
our equipment for happy social life.
Good reading yields not only profit but
pleasure to others. It is one means of
throwing brightness into home-life to
gather the children together and read
really well to them. And what a sweet
delight it is in the ward of a hospital, or
among the inmates of a workhouse, or
by the bedside of some dearly loved
invalid, to be able, by reading in soft,
gentle, refreshing tones, to charm away
the monotony and the weariness, perhaps
for awhile to relieve even the pain, of
the lonely and the suffering! We might
shed sunshine into the darkness of many
a life if, instead of spending our leisure
hours in <em>ennui</em> on ourselves, we devoted
them to reading aloud to others.</p>
</div>

<p>Reading aloud is good for ourselves
both physically and morally. It is good
morally, for if we never read anything
unfit for reading aloud we shall not
be likely to read anything morally
deteriorating. And physically, reading
aloud is a benignant exercise. It widens
the chest, opens the lungs, strengthens
the throat, and does good to all the
breathing organs. It is a mistake to
suppose that using the voice weakens it.
Abuse or misuse of the vocal organs, as
of any other organs, injures them; but
by proper use and exercise they are
strengthened and improved. Speakers
and preachers have bad throats not because
they use their throat too much, but
because they use it badly. They force
and torment it, instead of training it to
natural action and giving it free, full
play. And who shall blame them? At
school they were taught to spell and
mind their stops; but how to breathe
and manage the voice when reading, they
probably were not taught a single rule.
In many instances teachers themselves
are wholly ignorant of the art and therefore
incapable of teaching it. And so
it comes to pass that, unless either outward
circumstance or innate common-sense
turn our attention in later life to
the management of the vocal organs, we
never learn to read aloud without weariness
and with pleasure. It is mainly
through lack of early training that, of
all useful and delightful accomplishments,
the art of reading aloud is one of the
least practised and most rare.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/img156b.jpg" width="250" height="308" alt="Diggle" />
<div class="caption"><p>(<em>Photo: Russell and Sons, Baker Street, W.</em>)</p>
<p class="center">ARCHDEACON DIGGLE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Yet it is an art which, in some degree,
may be acquired by the majority of
people; very many could, by a little
training and perseverance, even excel
in it. Of course, the art admits of many
degrees of excellence. But without
reaching the splendid summits of the
art, attainable only by the highly gifted
few, ordinary persons may learn to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
read sufficiently well to gratify both
themselves and others, if they will take
pains to learn and practise a few simple
rules.</p>

<p>The first requirement is to master the
physics of the art: to learn to breathe
in through the nostrils and out through
the mouth, never to speak on an inflowing
breath, quickly to fill the lungs
and slowly to empty them, never to
gasp or strain after sound, not to
attempt the higher notes until the
lower have been completely mastered,
to rely more on the lower than the
higher notes, to teach the lips and
front portion of the mouth to do their
fair share of work equally with the
larynx and the vocal cords. A moustache
is an impediment to easy and distinct
reading. It hinders the air from passing
in free, full flow up the nostrils,
and it troubles the waves of sound as
they issue from the mouth; causing indistinctness,
more or less flat and thick,
in enunciation.</p>

<p>Clearness of enunciation ranks next in
importance after easy, natural, flexible
production of voice, and largely depends
on it, for there can be no clear, crisp,
distinct enunciation of words, unless the
tools by which words are made, viz. the
organs of voice, are kept sharp and well
burnished. Moreover, for the attainment
of limpid and finely articulated enunciation
careful training is required both
in the melody and modulation of sounds.</p>

<p>Precision and beauty of enunciation
are much assisted by habitual practice
of the graduated series of all the tones
from the keynote to its octave. Do not
sing when you are reading, but, in
order to read well, first learn to sing;
otherwise your reading will be flat and
monotonous, without light and shade,
instead of being fresh, richly modulated,
and melodious.</p>

<p>The next requirement of good reading
is to learn the relative value of the
letters, and the right handling of the
syllables, of which words are composed.</p>

<p>This study is both interesting and
attractive, for, as Plato observes, letters
themselves have a clear significance.
The letter <em>r</em> is expressive of motion,
the letters <em>d</em> and <em>t</em> of binding and rest,
the letter <em>l</em> of smoothness, <em>n</em> of inwardness,
the letter <em>e</em> of length and the
letter <em>o</em> of roundness.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Letters run in
families, and each family has its own
characteristic significance of sound.
Some letters belong to the lips, others
to the throat, others employ the whole
mouth. Vowels and final consonants are
the letters which demand most care and
support in good reading. For the most
part, vowels should be rich and full,
and the final consonant well sustained.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> <em>Cf.</em> Jowett's Plato, I. 311.</p></div>

<p>If letters in themselves are expressive
and significant, collocations of letters in
syllables and words are clearly more
significant still. "By various degrees of
strength or weakness, emphasis or pitch,
length or shortness, they become the
natural expressions both of the stronger
and the finer parts of human feeling
and thought." To read well, therefore,
it is necessary to give intelligent and
ready heed to the relative weight of
words, to notice whether consonants are
massed together to increase their density,
or vowels are freely interspersed to
leaven and make them light. True
enunciation largely depends on a careful
study of the natural formation of
words and a right appreciation of the
proportionate value of their several
syllables.</p>

<p>Reading, however, is frequently spoiled
by pedantry and exaggerated minuteness.
In seeking to avoid slovenliness
readers often fall into foppery. Good
reading goes at an easy pace, it is
neither too fast nor too slow; it neither
counts the letters nor omits them,
neither jumbles syllables together nor
anatomises words. The good reader
reads so that intelligent listeners can
spell his words, but he does not read
as if spelling them himself. He avoids
the extremes both of negligence and
nicety, and constantly remembers that
whatever is overdone is badly done.
Avoid ostentation. No rule in reading
is more fundamental than this.</p>

<p>Near akin to ostentation is the taint
of false and histrionic emphasis. Colourless
reading, bad though it be, is better
than tawdry reading. Especially in all
reading of a religious or sacred character
should affectation and dramatic
artifices be reverently avoided.</p>

<p>To read the Bible in church as if
playing a part on the stage is as inappropriate
and irreligious as to read like
one in haste to catch a train.</p>

<p>Each kind of subject demands its own
proper style in reading. Prose should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
not be read like poetry; nor all
kinds either of prose or poetry alike.
As in writing, each species should be
dressed in language from its own wardrobe;
so in reading, each several kind
should receive its own appropriate tone,
and travel at its own appropriate speed.
To read everything alike is to read nothing&mdash;or
at most only one thing&mdash;well.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/img158.jpg" width="450" height="381" alt="charming" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Charming away the monotony and the weariness.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Great authors are by no means invariably
good readers, even of their own
productions. Lord Tennyson read some
of his own glorious poems beautifully;
but others he read either droningly or
with too much singsong. Dickens read
his own works with wonderful power
and realisation. Wordsworth read his
own verse admirably; but we are told
that neither Coleridge nor Southey
could read verse well: "They read as
if crying or wailing lugubriously."</p>

<p>Reading, therefore, is an art which
doubtless requires, for the attainment
of excellence, some degree of histrionic
gifts&mdash;imagination, imitation, fervour, and
passion.</p>

<p>Similarly with oratory and authorship.
Both these arts are distinct from that
of reading; as each of these again is
distinct from the other.</p>

<p>It is curious, indeed, how few among
great authors are great orators; or,
among great orators, great authors. The
gifts which tell in writing&mdash;condensation,
terseness, finish&mdash;are not the gifts which
tell most in speaking. In speaking, the
essentials are clearness of enunciation,
sympathy with the audience, copiousness
of illustration, directness of statement,
uninvolved reasoning. The merits
which impart value to a book&mdash;wealth
of fact, niceness in balancing opposing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
considerations, delicacy of assertion,
depth and sweep of argument&mdash;may
easily become ineffective in the delivery
of a speech. Hence, therefore, whereas
a good speaker is occasionally a good
writer, owing to his rare combination
of different orders of talent, it more
frequently happens that the one set of
talents is given to one man to enrich
them in seclusion, and the other to
another man to use them with publicity.</p>

<p>In like manner with reading; it is an
art by itself. It is natural to suppose
that no one could possibly read an
author's works so well as the author's
self, because no one can understand
them so intimately as their own creator.
Yet experience proves this to be not
the case; and for a reason which at
first sight is not wholly apparent. It
is just because they are his own that,
as a rule, he cannot read them well.
He may have a richly cultivated voice,
clear enunciation, a varied power of
modulation; he may even be able to
read the works of others well, yet be a
failure in reading what he himself has
written. Why is this? Partly, perhaps,
it is due to an unavoidable self-consciousness
in reading his own works;
and self-consciousness is the ruin of
good reading. "Forget thyself" is a
necessary condition of good reading.
Partly, perhaps, it is due to over-absorption
in the memory of sensations
and sentiments which overpowered him
when he wrote in the solitude of his
chamber, but which are somewhat unnatural
and overstrained for exhibition
before a concourse of auditors. But probably
the principal reason is that one of
the greatest charms of good reading
arises from the co-operation of two
spirits toward one end&mdash;the spirit of the
author and the spirit of the reader. The
reader of another's works seeks actively
to express the spirit of his author, yet
unintentionally he is expressing his own
spirit also. The author enters into him
and he throws himself into the author;
his reading, therefore, is the union, the
marriage, the interpenetration and expression
of two spirits&mdash;the author's and
his own. However interesting, therefore,
and delightful it may be to hear an
author read his own works, yet is there
always lacking the dash and force and
suggestiveness produced when a great
author is interpreted by a great reader.
The author merely reproduces his original
meaning in what he wrote; the reader,
through the agency of his own independent
personality, idealises and diversifies
that meaning.</p>

<p>Idealisation is one of the most beautiful
effects of the fine art of reading.
The most ordinary poem or piece of
prose, when idealised by an accomplished
artist in reading, grows lovely
and sweet. And one way of learning to
read well ourselves is to sit at the feet
of some of these great masters of reading.
Until we have heard a great reader
read it is next to impossible to conceive
what a fine and noble art true
reading is. On the other hand, we can
never become good readers by merely
listening to others, any more than we
can become good musicians by hearing
others play.</p>

<p>In the art of reading, others may be
our models; none but ourselves can be
our makers. Listening to others may
show us how the thing can best be
done, but without doing the thing ourselves
the thing can never be truly
learned by us. Sometimes, indeed, listening
to others has an effect quite the
opposite of a model for imitation.
"Pausanias tells us of an ancient player
on the harp who was wont to make his
scholars go to hear one who played
badly that they might learn to hate
his discords and false measures." In like
manner, one way of learning to read well
is to hear others read badly.</p>

<p>The art of reading aloud culminates in
the expression of the spiritual through
the medium of the physical. As sculpture
aspires to express its ideals in stone, and
painting in colour, and music in sound,
so reading embodies its ideals in uttered
words. A well-trained voice, clearness of
enunciation, rhythm and flexibility of
articulation&mdash;these are the physical
framework of the art of reading aloud.
Without first acquiring these the reader
is as impotent as the painter without
colour or the sculptor without stone.
But the physics of reading are nothing
more than its material framework. Unless
the reader is inspired with ideals,
reading will never rise to the dignity
and glory of an art with him. He may
be as a house-painter with his brush, or
a mason with his stone&mdash;an industrious
and useful artificer, but not an artist in
his work.</p>

<h2>MIDGET CHURCHES</h2>

<p class="center">By J. A. Reid.</p>


<p>The subject of church architecture
is ever a fascinating one. Millions
of money and an immense
amount of time and labour have
been spent in erecting places of
worship, some of which are magnificent
structures capable of seating several
thousands. On the other hand, small,
humble edifices sometimes suffice to meet
the requirements of the worshippers;
and it is with these that we here propose
to deal.</p>

<p>Which of the midget churches is the
smallest it is somewhat difficult
to say; but it is believed that
the smallest church in England
is the truly miniature church of
Lullington, in Sussex. It is a
primitive and quaint building,
constructed of flint with stone
quoins, with a roof of red tiles.
It can boast of a little weather-boarded
turret at its west end;
but its bell does not toll now,
and the birds of the air have
long since found the turret a
convenient nesting-place. The
church is but sixteen feet
square. The pulpit is a pew,
with panelled sides and door,
and the furniture is of the
plainest. Five, narrow, diamond-paned
windows throw a
scanty light upon the interior,
in which there is accommodation
for thirty persons&mdash;quite
sufficient for the population of
the village.</p>

<p class="center">LULLINGTON CHURCH.</p>

<p class="center">(<em>Sixteen feet square.</em>)</p></div>
</div>

<p>A somewhat larger edifice is
the very interesting church of
Wythburn, in Cumberland, the
dimensions of which are&mdash;nave
(length), thirty-nine feet; height
of walls, ten feet; and width,
fifteen feet. This was the
original church, erected about
one hundred and sixty years ago,
and is of the simplest description.
The roof is constructed
of old ships' timber, and the
windows are square holes with
wooden frames. The chancel is eighteen
feet long by fifteen feet by ten feet. The
beautiful little east window is by Henry
Holiday, and was put in to the memory
of the late vicar. What a magnificent
site for a church! The poets have thus
expressed themselves with regard to this
humble but beautifully situated church:&mdash;</p>

<p>Canon H. D. Rawnsley wrote:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"We cannot stay&mdash;for life is but an Inn,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A halfway house&mdash;and, lo! the graves how near!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Yet mighty minds have hither come for cheer<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Before the upward path they dared begin.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
<span class="i1">Here Gray the pilgrim rested pale and thin,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Here Wilson laughed, and Wordsworth murmured here.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Here Coleridge mused, and ere he crossed the mere<br /></span>

<span class="i1">And we who would Helvellyn's height essay,<br /></span>

<p class="center">WYTHBURN CHURCH.</p>

<p class="center">(<em>Thirteen yards long, five yards wide.</em>)</p></div>
</div>

<p>Wordsworth, too, said:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"If Wythburn's modest House of Prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As lowly as the lowliest dwelling,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Had, with its belfry's humble stock,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A little pair that hang in air,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Been mistress also of a clock<br /></span>
<span class="i1">(And one, too, not hung in crazy plight),<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Twelve strokes that clock would have been telling<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Under the brow of old Helvellyn."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>And H. Coleridge:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Humble it is, and meek, and very low,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And speaks its purpose by a single bell:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But God Himself, and He alone, can know<br /></span>
<span class="i1">If spiry temples please Him half so well."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>We have given two instances of very
small churches: let us now refer to a
midget chapel. At Crawshawbooth, a
village near Burnley, there is an extremely
interesting diminutive place of
worship known as the Friends' Meeting-House,
an old-fashioned building covered
with ivy, and environed by a well-cared-for
burial ground. It contains
half a dozen oak benches, on
which the worshippers sit.
Though these benches are
sufficient to provide seating
accommodation for about
sixty, the attendance is
rarely more than six. John Bright once
worshipped here, walking from Rochdale,
a distance of twelve miles. This quaint
little place is naturally regarded with
much interest by visitors.</p>

<p>It is interesting to point out that
there is another Quaker meeting-house
in the hamlet of Jordans, in
Buckinghamshire, which is, if anything,
smaller than that already referred to.
It has been called the Shrine of
Quakerism, for early in June every year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
a gathering of Quakers takes place.
Here lie the remains of William Penn,
one of the greatest of Quakers. At
a cottage in the vicinity Milton wrote
his "Paradise Lost."</p>

<p class="center">(<em>Containing six oak benches to accommodate sixty worshippers.</em>)</p></div>
</div>

<p>To revert to churches, Kilpeck Church
is well worth referring to as being a
lovely little place of worship. The nave
is thirty-six feet by twenty, and the
chancel seventeen by sixteen feet ten
inches, the total length being sixty-eight
feet and the average breadth about sixteen
feet. It is built upon a Saxon
foundation, and Saxon remains are still
to be seen&mdash;notably, a "holy-water"
stoup that must be one thousand or
eleven hundred years old. It is not
possible to do justice to this beautiful
church in a few words, but the accompanying
photograph will give an idea
of the quaintness and beauty of the
structure. The sculpture is remarkably
interesting.</p>

<p>An article on midget places of worship
would be incomplete without a reference
to the little lath-and-plaster church
of Essex, consisting of nave, chancel, and
a small turret. Hazeleigh Church, as it
is named, stands in the near vicinity of
Hazeleigh Hall&mdash;once the home of the
Essex family of the Alleynes, one of
whom founded the College of God's Gift<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
at Dulwich. This little church has thus
been described by the Rev. H. R. Wadmore,
sometime curate:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"... A little church beside a wood<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Securely sheltered from the sweeping blast;<br /></span>

<p class="center">CHILCOMBE CHURCH.</p>

<p class="center">(<em>Twelve yards long.</em>)</p></div>
</div>

<p>This little church
of Hazeleigh, owing
to its simple character,
differs but
slightly from the
roadside cottages.
It has been styled
"the meanest
church in Essex,"
owing to its unpretentious
character.</p>

</div>

<p>A pleasing little
church is that of
Chilcombe, near
Bridport, Dorsetshire.
Chilcombe is
mentioned in the
Doomsday Book,
and at one time
was the property
of the Knight Hospitallers
of St. John.
The existing church
dates from the thirteenth
century. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
is in the Roman style, and possesses a
good Norman font. The length of the
nave is twenty-two by fourteen feet, the
chancel being thirteen by
eleven feet. The owner
of the parish and the
patron of the living is Admiral the Hon.
M. H. Nelson.</p>

</div>

<p>Another remarkably small church is
that of St. Peter, on the Castle Rise,
at Cambridge, its dimensions
being twenty-five by sixteen
feet. It is of Norman architecture.</p>

<p>England by no means possesses
all the diminutive
churches and chapels, and a very quaint
and interesting church is that of Ledaig,
near Oban. It is unsectarian, and its
congregation numbers, on the average,
twenty-five. It was founded by John
Campbell, who was more familiarly
known as "The Bard of Benderlock." He
converted a natural cavern in the cliffs
of Ledaig into a place of worship. A
portion of a trunk of a tree, on which
Robert Bruce is said to have
rested, serves as a table and
reading-desk. Trunks of trees
around the sides of the cavern
serve as seats for the worshippers.
Mr. Campbell officiated as minister
for many years to a band of
faithful Highland worshippers in
this curious church. Mr. Campbell
was a remarkable personality.
He was postmaster of Ledaig,
and he also gained a considerable
reputation as a poet. He was a
much respected man, and his
memory is dear to many.</p>

<p class="center">ST. MARGARET'S CHAPEL, EDINBURGH CASTLE.</p>

<p class="center">(<em>For some time used as a powder magazine.</em>)</p></div>
</div>

<p>I would like to refer to a very
interesting midget church at
Grove, near Leighton Buzzard, which I
had the pleasure of visiting recently. It
is the smallest in the county, and is a
gable-roofed, barn-like fabric, with a door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
on the north side. In 1883 the little church
was restored throughout, the fine old-fashioned
square pews being replaced by
open wooden seats, and it is now
capable of seating about fifty people.
Formerly the edifice contained a "three-decker"&mdash;clerk's
desk, reading-desk, and
pulpit combined. The churchyard contains
many graves, but only one tombstone
(eighteenth century). The dimensions of
the church are&mdash;length, twenty-nine and
a half feet; width, eighteen feet; height,
about forty feet; in all probability, the
church was formerly larger than at
present. Grove is generally considered
to be one of the smallest parishes in
England, and one could hardly conceive
of a smaller. It consists practically
of a farmhouse and a lock-keeper's
cottage.</p>

</div>

<p>We must not forget that at the top of
Edinburgh Castle is the historical diminutive
chapel of St. Margaret's, which was
the private chapel of the pious Margaret,
Queen of Malcolm III., during
her residence in the castle. Until
very recently it had been quite lost
sight of, having been converted into
a powder magazine and fallen into disrepair.
In 1853, however, it was "discovered"
and put into an efficient state
of repair. It is considered to be the
oldest and smallest chapel in Scotland,
its dimensions being sixteen feet six
inches by ten feet sixteen inches. The
semicircular chancel is separated from the
nave by a well-carved double-round arch,
decorated with Norman zigzag mouldings.
It is too small to be made available for
divine service for the troops quartered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
in the castle, and the only use that it
is now put to is for occasional baptisms
and morning Communion.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>There are several very small places of
worship which are now, alas! in ruins.
At Iona, for instance, on the west coast
of Scotland, are the remains of an
extremely small chapel, known as St.
Oran's Chapel. It is very near Iona
Cathedral. It is constructed of red
granite, and its external measurements
are sixty feet by twenty-two feet. It is
now roofless, and is very old. This
little chapel is believed to have been
built by Queen Margaret in 1080. Its
architecture is Romanesque, and it has
one low entrance. This humble edifice
is interesting inasmuch as within its
walls is the tomb of Sir Walter Scott's
"Lord of the Isles," the friend of Bruce.</p>

<p class="center">DIMINUTIVE CHAPEL AT POINT IN VIEW, NEAR EXMOUTH.</p>

<p class="center">(<em>Containing an organ made by the pastor.</em>)</p></div>
</div>

<p>There is another tiny barn-like edifice
at Greenloaning, near Dunblane. The
little church is situated adjacent to a
farmhouse, and seems to have been
erected for the benefit of the farm-workers.
It is remarkably small. The
scenery in the vicinity is magnificent,
and the church is regarded with much
interest by tourists.</p>

<p>St. Anthony's Chapel is another small
building also in ruins. It is interesting
owing to its historic surroundings, being
in the near vicinity of Holyrood Palace.
It comprises a hermitage, sixteen feet
long, twelve feet wide, and eight feet high,
and a Gothic chapel forty-three feet
long, eighteen feet broad, and eighteen
feet high.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable of
these little churches is that at Knaresborough,
in Yorkshire, which is a very
queer little chapel elegantly hewn out
of the solid rock, the roof being beautifully
ribbed and groined in the Gothic
style. At the back of the altar is a
large niche, where an image used to
stand, and on one side of it is a place
for the "holy-water" basin. There are
also figures of three heads&mdash;designed, it is
believed, for an emblematical allusion to
the order of the monks at the once neighbouring
priory. Possibly they were cut
by some of the monks. The order was
known as Sanctæ Trinitatis. A few yards
away there is another head. It has been
surmised that this is a representation of
St. John the Baptist, to whom the chapel
is supposed to be dedicated. There is a
cavity in the floor, in which some ancient
relic was rested. The chapel is ten
feet six inches long, nine feet wide, and
seven and a half feet high. Near the entrance
is the following inscription:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Beneath yon ivy's spreading shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For lonely contemplation made,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">An ancient chapel stands complete,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Once the hermit's calm retreat<br /></span>
<span class="i1">From worldly pomp and sordid care,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To humble penitence and prayer;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The sight is pleasing, all agree&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Do, gentle stranger, turn and see."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>The chapel is known as St. Robert's
Chapel. St. Robert, the hermit who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
used it for devotions, was born about
1160, and was the son of Sir Toke Flouris,
who was mayor of the city of York. In
his youth he was noted for his piety, and
he entered the Cistercian Abbey of Newminster
in Northumberland. He was
only there eighteen weeks, however,
removing to York, and then to Knaresborough,
where he retired from the
world to live a life of contemplation in
this restful spot. He died in the September
of 1218. On one side of the entrance
to the chapel, under the ivy, is the figure
of a Knight Templar, cut in the rock, in
the act of drawing his sword to defend
the place from the violence of intruders.
This is a queer and remarkable building,
and, though not now used as a place of
worship, the reference here made to it
may prove interesting.</p>

<p class="center">INTERIOR VIEW OF PERIVALE CHURCH.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The cathedral of St. Asaph, in Flintshire,
might be mentioned in this category
as being the smallest cathedral in
the country. It is in the shape of a
simple cross in plan, consisting of a choir
transept, nave, with five bays with
aisles, and a central tower forty feet
square and one hundred feet high. The
choir was built in 1867-68 from the designs
of the late Sir Gilbert Scott, R.A.,
and is of Early English architecture.</p>

<p>Passing references might also be made
to the diminutive church of Warlingham,
in Surrey, which runs the midget church
of Wotton in that county very close;
and to Grosmont Church, Monmouth,
erected by Eleanor of Provence, a quaint
little structure with an octagonal tower.
There used to be a church known as
St. Mildred in the Poultry, which was
removed to Lincolnshire. It formerly
occupied a position in the eastern end of
Cheapside, and in 1872 it was taken to
pieces and re-erected at Louth. It is
generally considered to be the smallest
church designed by Wren.</p>

<p>At St. Andrew, Greensted, near Ongar,
there is a very small church, and it is
a curiosity, inasmuch as it is believed
to be a relic of the only church of Saxon
origin built of wood remaining.</p>

<p>There is a small chapel at Point in
View, near Exmouth. It is Congregational,
and it provides seating accommodation
for eighty persons, and forms one side
of a block, the other three sides being
taken up by four little almshouses, each
consisting of two rooms occupied by four
elderly maiden ladies. Over the chapel
door is this motto:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"One Point in View<br /></span>
<span class="i1">We all pursue."<br /></span>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>
<p>The chapel contains a diminutive organ
made by the pastor. In the vicinity there
is a peculiar round house, the property
of the Reichel family. It was a member
of this family who founded the chapel
and almshouses.</p>

<p>The little church of St. Nicholas at
Hulcote should be mentioned. It is
near Woburn, the seat of the Duke
of Bedford. It is rather difficult to find,
at any rate when the foliage is on the
trees, so surrounded is it by them. It
was built about the year 1610 by Richard
Chernocke. Its measurements are: length,
from the tower to the chancel step,
thirty-nine and a half feet; chancel, eight
and a half feet from step to east; width,
sixteen feet three inches. There are carved
oaken panels to many of the seats, and
on the north wall, inside the chancel
rails, are some valuable old monuments
in memory of the Chernocke family. It
is now between fifteen and twenty years
since the church was used for divine
service, but it is still used for funerals.</p>

<p>There is a little church, near London,
known as Perivale. Although so near to
the great metropolis, it is situated in a
peculiarly lonely district. It lies in the
valley of the Brent amid expansive
meadows and hay farms. In 1871 there
were only seven houses and thirty-three
inhabitants in the
parish. The midget
church is situated
at the end of a
field near a low,
semi-Gothic half-timber
parsonage
and a farmhouse.
Although somewhat
desolate, the spot is
a restful one, and
the hill and spire of
Harrow in the distance
make the
scene pleasing to
the eye. The little
church is in the
Early Perpendicular
style, and consists
of a nave, a narrow
chancel, a rough
wooden tower with
short, pyramidal
spire at the west,
and porch on the
south-west. The
interior presents a
well-kept appearance. The church was restored
in 1875. In the windows is some late
fifteenth-century glass containing figures
of St. John the Baptist and St. Matthew, in
fairly good condition, and of Mary and
Joseph, which are not so well preserved.</p>

<p>The prettily situated ivy-clad church of
St. Lawrence, Ventnor, Isle of Wight,
is another edifice which might well be
described as a midget church, although
some years ago it was found necessary
to enlarge it. The church originally
was thirty feet eight and a half inches
long, it is now forty feet eight and a
half inches; and its breadth was formerly
eleven feet, whereas it is now twenty
feet. The height to the eaves is about
six feet. The architecture is Old English,
but not at all striking. The church
dates back to about the year 1190.</p>

<p>We have now exhausted our space, but
not our subject. There are other examples
of diminutive churches throughout
the country, but we have made a
selection of the more interesting ones.
However small the church, the worshippers
have this assurance from the
Founder of the Christian religion: "Where
two or three are gathered together in
My name, there am I in the midst of
them"; and with that quotation this
little article may fittingly be concluded.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>A PREMATURE PROPOSAL.</h3>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/img169b.jpg" alt="I" width="100" height="137" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_1">I n the Canons' Court, between
Mr. Bethune's
and the Deanery, lived
Mr. Warde. He was
a pleasant man, well
off, artistic, musical&mdash;and
happy in a life of
little work, which left
him leisure for his
artistic pursuits. He
had a rosy, kind face
and plump figure; the
Bethune children, Marjorie
included, went to him before anyone
else in times of need. He had often shielded
them from offended law.</p>
</div>

<p>It was he who set on foot the literary
and drawing guilds, arranged concerts, and
was the universal handy man for games and
social festivities to all the county round
Norham. He was about thirty-five, and had
a chivalric devotion to Mrs. Bethune and
her children, since, as a young man, he had
first come to Norham.</p>

<p>Marjorie was so accustomed to this that
she did not see what was manifest to other
eyes, on her return from school in Munich.
She took all his kindness as a matter of
course, having no more relation to herself
individually than the Bishop's or the Dean's.
Since her return, he had been sedulously
pursuing his courtship in every way that
occurred to him.</p>

<p>This gentleman was standing beside her
under the lime-tree at the top of the garden,
where Marjorie could superintend the
pursuits of her two youngest brothers. They
were now busily engaged underground. For
a whole week every minute of David's and
Sandy's leisure had been spent in digging
a deep hole in the corner of the garden devoted
to their use. Thence, with infinite
patience, passages had been scooped, and the
mound of earth thrown up against the wall
had come in useful as a toboggan ground.</p>

<p>The little boys had received strict orders
that morning that all the earth in the passages
of the "cave," which, in a frenzy of
labour, the two schoolboys had burrowed
out before breakfast, was to be removed
before their return in the afternoon. As it
got deeper, steps had been conveyed from
the house for the descent of the hole. The
utility of division of labour had been impressed
upon the children. Orme was to
fill the baskets; Ross, being surer of his
equilibrium, was to carry them up and empty
them. If the work was not done, and done
properly, the babies would have to play
elsewhere; no longer would their presence
be tolerated by their elders.</p>

<p>Marjorie was enjoying a new book, whose
alluring cover was fit index to its contents.
Now and then, between the pages, dark eyes
looked at her in a strange and wonderful
fashion. When this occurred, she would lift
her own, and gaze dreamily over the currant
bushes, her breath coming quickly, the
colour fluctuating in her cheeks. Upon one
such moment Mr. Warde had intruded.</p>

<p>"I thought I would come in and talk to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
you about your sonnet, Marjorie," he said,
looking about for a seat. There was nothing
handy except a cleft log&mdash;used by the boys
as a block for chopping sticks. On this
uncomfortable seat Mr. Warde poised himself.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/img170.jpg" width="450" height="341" alt="looking" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">The man, looking at her, thought he might take hope.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"But that wouldn't be fair, would it?"
asked Marjorie.</p>

<p>"Oh! we judged the poems yesterday. I
didn't propose to alter anything. Mrs.
Adeane's is the best, and Lady Esther's next.
But&mdash;your usual imagination was wanting
this time," he said gently.</p>

<p>"I thought it was bad&mdash;it seemed so
prosaic," Marjorie said humbly. "You see,
father's advice always is, not to let imagination
go further than it knows."</p>

<p>"Have you never imagined, never thought
about love?" he asked softly.</p>

<p>"Often, lately," frankly. "I thought it
was a very silly subject to choose."</p>

<p>"Not silly, Marjorie. The loveliest poetry
has been written about it, as it is the loveliest
subject. Why 'lately'?" he asked.</p>

<p>"To get ideas. They don't come, if you
don't think&mdash;not to me, at least."</p>

<p>"That way of putting it is new," he said,
considering. "Well, Marjorie, I want you
to think of it, to imagine all you can of
what it means&mdash;the new brightness, the new
beauty it gives to life; how it transforms
all things, even the commonest, so that&mdash;&mdash;"
He paused. Marjorie was looking at him in
wonder.</p>

<p>Was it something in his glance that
brought irresistibly back to her remembrance
that look in Mr. Pelham's dark eyes, of
which more than once that afternoon she
had been thinking? She coloured brightly,
and her beautiful eyes grew soft.</p>

<p>"Ah! I see you know what I mean," Mr.
Warde said gently.</p>

<p>"Oh! I don't," said Marjorie confusedly.
But the man, looking at her, thought he
might take hope. He went on:</p>

<p>"It is expressed in all beautiful music, as
well as in the best literature and art. It
appeals to everyone, because it is natural
to all, and answers to something in the
heart of every one of us. So you see, Marjorie,
knowing you and your gift of imagination,
I am disappointed at this bald little
verse."</p>

<p>"Father says it is dangerous imagining on
nothing," Marjorie replied, plucking up her
spirit. "First get facts, absolutely accurate.
Then build on them."</p>

<p>"Well, Marjorie, don't you realise that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the facts are all about you, that I&mdash;&mdash;Whatever's
the matter?"</p>

<p>A yell broke across the summer air, and
Marjorie, springing up, bent over the edge
of the crater-like hole. At the bottom lay
Orme, his basket beside him, its contents
upon him. In a second Marjorie had
descended underground, and Mr. Warde was
left gazing into space.</p>

<p>When she emerged, Orme was in her arms,
muddy tears bedewing his cherubic cheeks.
"Fall'd," he announced, in a self-pitying tone,
to the visitor.</p>

<p>Marjorie reseated herself, her little brother's
head upon her breast. As she comforted
him, the man observing her grew more in
love than ever. Marjorie, soft and gentle, unconsciously
rehearsing Madonna attitudes, gave
him a thrill of delight. Presently the boy,
his conscience uneasy over neglected work,
slipped from her knee, and, with muttered
remarks on "er, nasty ground," descended
again into its bosom.</p>

<p>He had learnt the imprudence of engaging
in another man's labour. Resenting the
meaner part of filling the baskets for the
more stolid and surefooted Ross to ascend
and empty, he had been promptly punished
for his ambition. His little soul was now
sore with the injustice of things.</p>

<p>"Er, nasty steps slipped poor Orme," he
said to Ross, watching his careful ascent.</p>

<p>"You not big anuff," Ross answered importantly.
"Go and fill er basket. Do what
David bidded you."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. Warde had glanced at his
watch. Soon, all too soon, this semi-solitude
in which he had been fortunate enough to
find Marjorie would be invaded by the schoolboys.
He was no nearer the end for which
he had come, and he could not again drag
in Marjorie's little verse for criticism. She
glanced at him, as she drew the alluring
book towards her, and said, not too politely:</p>

<p>"If you are going to stay, I'll just fetch
my work," rising as she spoke.</p>

<p>"No, Marjorie, don't go. There's something
I specially wished to say, to talk to
you about," he said, becoming a little confused
under her unconscious gaze. Could he,
after all, disturb this serenity by the suggestion
of love and marriage? He felt
somehow that the time was not ripe&mdash;that
they would seem incongruous to her in
connection with himself. And yet, if he did
not speak, and be quick about it, another
man might step in.</p>

<p>"I have had a letter to-day," he said,
"offering me a college living."</p>

<p>"Have you?" said Marjorie in a not altogether
flattering manner, and looking at him
rather as though she were much surprised.
She stood poised, ready to fetch the threatened
work; her attitude altogether an unflattering
one to a lover who has just made an
important communication.</p>

<p>"You won't go, shall you?" she went on,
her glance going past him to the wall
which divided the gardens. Over the top
big clusters of the roses in which Mr. Warde
delighted nodded gaily, whilst further on
the square face of his house was gay
with bloom, amid which the two lines of
windows stared a little baldly. The blind in
each was arranged symmetrically, and in
spite of its prim tidiness, even its outside
showed that no loved woman ruled within.
From her neighbour's house Marjorie's eyes
jumped to her own home.</p>

<p>Here there was no symmetry, but its
character as a home stood out plain. The
nursery windows, distinguished by their
guarding bars, were wide open, and the
blinds drawn to the top, whilst in the three
open windows of her mother's room adjoining
the curtains flopped lazily, and the
blinds had been adjusted to the sun. Somehow
the sight and the difference brought a
feeling into Marjorie's heart which had not
yet stirred it in connection with Mr.
Warde. Hitherto he had not seemed to her
to need pity. But now, when he went back
into his house&mdash;away from her and the
homely garden, where vegetables, and currant
bushes, and the untidy quarter of the boys,
were of more account than flowers, where
little feet pattered, and boys' voices were
never silent&mdash;what would he go back to?
The blank windows lit up empty rooms,
where no foot but his own stirred. He
would find no companionship but that of
his music and his books. Marjorie never
guessed of the visions that peopled his fireside.</p>

<p>"Shall you go?" she asked, looking at
him&mdash;then speaking out suddenly the pity her
thoughts had called up: "Won't it be very
lonely?"</p>

<p>"Very. Sit down please, Marjorie, and
listen to me."</p>

<p>Then, as she complied: "When first I
came here, ten years ago, your father and
mother were very kind to me, and I grew
so attached to them and theirs, that I
wanted nothing more. I felt no need of
the ties other men have or make, because I
had&mdash;you." Then his tone grew tender.
"Do you remember how you used to come
round and climb into my study window for
your lessons, when the boys began to go
to school? You were a bit forsaken then,
Marjorie. And then, when you were good&mdash;as
you weren't always&mdash;how a little pony
accompanied me on my rides, and then
when the pony and the child who rode it
had each grown bigger, one day they both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
disappeared. The child went to school, to
come back, nearly grown up, with music
oozing out of her fingers' ends. Well,
Marjorie" (he had risen, and his face was
paling, his self-control vanishing, as he
stood looking down on her), "I have waited
a long time for that little girl&mdash;who has yet
seemed always mine&mdash;I want her for my
wife. Will you go with me, dear, if I go?"</p>

<p>Marjorie gazed blankly into his face. "I?
Of course, it is me," she said slowly. "I
don't know&mdash;I didn't think&mdash;how can I
leave&mdash;everybody?" her voice faltered.</p>

<p>She rose suddenly, putting aside the hand
that would have stayed her. There is
nothing so cruel as a young thing who
has no notion of her power and of the
devotion she has stirred.</p>

<p>"I didn't think," she said, cuttingly,
"that you wanted payment. I thought&mdash;I
thought&mdash;&mdash;" And then, not trusting her
voice further, she sprang away from his
detaining hand, and fled.</p>


<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>MARJORIE'S TROUBLE.</h3>


<p>"Dear Marjorie,&mdash;You gave me no
answer yesterday, and I am afraid
I took you by surprise, and perhaps
shocked you. A girl is a tender
thing, I know. Will you send me just a
little line of hope and forgiveness? I love
you&mdash;how dearly you cannot guess&mdash;and I
want you to be my wife. But I will press
nothing against your will, and I have written
'No' to the offer of that living. I think you
will like to stay near home. Whatever you
decide, whether you say 'Yes' or 'No,' believe
always that my love is too great to change,
and that I am ever your attached friend,&mdash;<span class="smcap">W.
St. J. Warde.</span>"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Marjorie was reading this letter with an expression
which certainly did not augur well for
its writer. She had been seeing to household
matters for her mother, and had sat down
with an armful of boys' clothes to mend,
when the note had been handed to her.</p>

<p>"I do not know what to say to him,
mother. I wish&mdash;oh, I do so wish he hadn't
done it."</p>

<p>"He is a good man, Margie," her mother
said simply. "A man, I think, to make you
happy."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/img172.jpg" width="450" height="265" alt="good man" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"He is a good man, Margie."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Happy, mother? I am happy now. What
should I do next door? I should always be
running in to see you. And how could you
get on without me?"</p>

<p>"We shall manage. And next door with
Mr. Warde would be so much nicer than a
long way off with someone else. It would
scarcely be losing you."</p>

<p>"Do you want me to go, mother?" asked
Marjorie, struck by her mother's tone.</p>

<p>"Not in one sense, dear; but you will go. It
is natural for girls to marry. You will marry,
I hope; it is the happiest life, with a good
man you can look up to."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>"But do I look up to him? I think we&mdash;Charity
and I&mdash;often laugh at him."</p>

<p>"But you can laugh, and yet look up, or
life would be very dull. Who do you go to
when you want to know anything that father
can't teach you?"</p>

<p>"To Mr. Warde," acknowledged Marjorie.</p>

<p>"And when you want to go anywhere?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but only because he has a carriage&mdash;and
we haven't."</p>

<p>"And when you want to see the picture
galleries?"</p>

<p>"He can go; he always has time. But
all that doesn't mean that I want to marry
him," she added.</p>

<p>"But it is just that. You already look to
him for most of your pleasures. That is a
long way towards loving him. You would
find him a very kind husband and friend."</p>

<p>"Oh! mother, what must I do?" entreated
Marjorie, the tears coming into her eyes. "He
has spoilt everything. It is Charity's garden-party
this afternoon, and I shall be so uncomfortable.
Couldn't you go, mother, in your
chair?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Bethune's face changed.</p>

<p>"I could, dear. Yes, I will go; perhaps it
will be difficult for you." She sighed softly;
she was hardly as yet reconciled to her
helplessness in public, in spite of the cheery
spirit which enabled her to bear suffering
with such courage.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bethune's spirit made her the idol and
confidante of her boys. Her fun was unquenched,
even when the fire of life would
seem to have gone out for ever; after the
terrible fall, when, to save the infant in her
arms, she had laid herself upon her back for
life. The baby&mdash;Orme&mdash;was found unhurt,
folded round, so it seemed, by the broken
body of his mother. Ross, the most thoughtful,
she averred, of her six sons, once said to
her:</p>

<p>"Mummie, you do laugh mor'n anybody.
Is it 'cos you can't walk?"</p>

<p>"Yes, little son, perhaps it is; to make up,
you know."</p>

<p>And Sandy, butting his bright head into her
knees one day, inconsolable about something,
was won to laughter by, "Sandy, laugh!
Look at me!"&mdash;and he had looked. And the
irresistible witchery of the beautiful dark eyes
had cured his woe. She was always the sunshiny
centre of the house, and only her husband,
or Marjorie in rare moments, guessed
how sometimes the bright spirit quailed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Dean was popular in the county. When
Mr. Pelham came into the Deanery garden
somewhat late, he found Mrs. Bethune's chair
under the chestnut trees, a centre of laughter
and conversation. Marjorie was standing by
her mother, with a wistful look on her face,
he thought at first sight, wondering at its
expression. Love, when presented first to a
girl brought up as Marjorie had been, comes
as a great shock. That it should be Mr.
Warde of all men who should cause her this
disquiet filled Marjorie with a sense of the
unsatisfactoriness of the world. It disturbed
things that had seemed to her as settled as
the hills round Norham that this old friend
should want to be her lover.</p>

<p>Before going to the Deanery she had sent
a little note in answer to his letter, in
which she had said&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is nothing to forgive. But you
must not think of me like this any more.
You have always been so kind to all of us
that it grieves me to say 'No' to anything
you want. Still, it must be 'No.'"</p>

<p>She hoped he would not be present at the
Deanery. It was his turn of duty at the
cathedral. She would bring her mother away
early, before he arrived. The afternoon was
quite spoilt for her.</p>

<p>And then Mr. Pelham had come up, and
she had introduced him to her mother with
a tremulousness and agitation quite unlike
her usual serenity.</p>

<p>"You have been very good to my boys,"
Mrs. Bethune said gratefully.</p>

<p>"Your boys have been very good to my
little girl," he answered, admiring the delicate
beauty of the face, scarcely looking older
than the unquiet one of the tall daughter
beside her.</p>

<p>"They're very enterprising," their mother
said. "I hope she will not come to any
harm with them. They're apt to give us
surprises."</p>

<p>"I wonder if you will give me some advice
about her," he went on, drawn by some
magic in the dark eyes to appeal to their
owner for sympathy, "if I may consult you.
It is about clothes," he said, smiling. "My
nurse is kind and careful, but surely a baby
in the country does not really need expensive
dresses from a Regent Street outfitter. I
should be so grateful if you would tell me
where you get those pretty things your
little boys always look so nice in."</p>

<p>"Even when they are grubby?" laughed
the mother. "I do not know where they
could be bought. My nurse, and Marjorie, and
I make them."</p>

<p>"Then, if you do, surely my nurse ought
to have time. I do not like my baby's
over-dressed look; at least, white satin seems
to be out of keeping with mud-pies and
digging. She is great on digging just now."</p>

<p>"Quite so," said Mrs. Bethune. "If you
will send your nurse down to see me, I will
have a talk with her."</p>

<p>The Duchess of Norham, a very great
person indeed now came up to greet Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Bethune. She was not one who troubled
about dress. To-day, in her grey silk,
and round hat, she was the most plainly
dressed woman on the Deanery lawn.
Charity, by her side, was an effective contrast,
in soft, shimmering pink.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you out again, my dear,"
she said to Mrs. Bethune. "And this is
your girl come back to you&mdash;grown past all
knowledge. I hear wonders about her
music," kindly. "Charity, may I take her
away for a few minutes, presently? I want
to hear this music Mr. Warde extols so.
Where is he?" looking round.</p>

<p>Marjorie's cheeks, in spite of her usual self-control,
turned scarlet. But the Duchess's
gaze was arrested by the look on Mr.
Pelham's face. He, still standing with a hand
on Mrs. Bethune's chair, was looking at
Marjorie with a surprised appeal in his
expression, as if he, too, was wondering at
her sudden flush.</p>

<p>"Oh!" thought the Duchess, "I imagined
it was Charity. Was I mistaken then? Not
about the girl, if those rosy cheeks are to
be trusted."</p>

<p>"Why isn't Mr. Warde here?" she asked
of Marjorie, who, in obedience to her
gesture, turned with her towards the house.</p>

<p>"He is at the cathedral. It is his week."</p>

<p>And the Duchess thought she guessed
rightly the reason of the agitation she
detected in Marjorie's voice.</p>

<p>"The Blackton man will be unsuccessful,"
she settled. "But Charity is pretty enough to
console him, and it will be a good marriage
for them both."</p>

<p>This great lady was never more happy
than when arranging marriages amongst her
friends.</p>

<p>Marjorie did not dream how her sudden
flush had betrayed her, and forgot lovers
and the difficulties they caused when she
sat down to the piano. But perhaps it was
the perplexity in her mind that conveyed
itself to the listener, through the plaintive
melody ending in a staccato phrase which
fell from her fingers.</p>

<p>The Duchess sat at a little distance,
viewing with approval the delicate face,
framed in its bright hair.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/img175.jpg" width="450" height="422" alt="hush" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"Hush! Barbe, don't call!" entreated Sandy.&mdash;<em>p. 168</em>.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Good, pure, true, and strong," she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
settled; "and," as a sudden conviction struck
her, "she is beautiful, like her mother was
ten years ago. Dressed"&mdash;her thoughts following
along the same way as Charity's&mdash;"well,
she would be a success. She is wasted on
Mr. Warde. Shall I interfere?"</p>

<p>She was so deep in thought, working out
a sudden plan, that she did not notice when
Marjorie ceased playing.</p>

<p>Marjorie, glancing at her, asked softly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Was that too sad? Shall I try something
else?"</p>

<p>But in a moment the Duchess rose briskly,
and put her hand kindly on Marjorie's
shoulder.</p>

<p>"No, my dear. I shouldn't like that
spoiled by anything else. Mr. Warde is
right. You have a gift. But a girl like you
should not be sad or&mdash;or perplexed. Forgive
an old woman. Is something troubling you?"</p>

<p>Marjorie looked up into the keen eyes
above her.</p>

<p>"Not troubling," she hesitated, "only
things are sometimes perplexing."</p>

<p>As she spoke her eyes travelled to the
window, through which came the sound of
low-voiced chatter and delicate laughter.
The older woman, looking at the girl, saw
a sudden arrested look come into her eyes
and, following their direction, was again
puzzled. Charity, standing by Mrs. Bethune's
chair, was smiling up into Mr. Pelham's face.
She had the manner of one who is pleased,
and who wishes to please, and her pretty
daintiness of pose and dress was very attractive.
Mr. Pelham's whole attention, as he conversed,
was given to her. In his courteous attitude
were expressed, in the eyes of the two lookers-on,
both deference and admiration.</p>

<p>"That girl has grown very pretty," the
Duchess said, "and Mr. Pelham seems to
think so. He is quite an acquisition here,
though I am amused to hear you sniffed at
him at first."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Marjorie, a little pang at her
heart.</p>

<p>The keen eyes travelled back again to
Marjorie's face.</p>

<p>"But your mother was prettier than any
of you. The sweetest, merriest creature ever
seen, with you babies at her feet. I am glad
to see her so much better, able to do even
this little, poor soul, poor soul!"</p>

<p>The sudden tears welled up into Marjorie's
eyes at the appreciation and tenderness of
the tone.</p>

<p>"And, my dear&mdash;forgive an old woman
again&mdash;but I think I have guessed Mr. Warde's
hopes for a long time, and he is a good man.
There, there"&mdash;as Marjorie's face grew agitated&mdash;"nothing
could have happened better.
Your mother will have you at hand, and
though she is so unselfish and brave, she
has missed you sadly; and there is plenty of
money."</p>

<p>Marjorie listened in silence, with a feeling
as though chains were being bound round
her. As she walked back by the Duchess's
side to her mother's chair she strove in vain
to recall her courage. In the eyes of the
man who watched her, as she came towards
him, the shadow on her face had deepened
with that little excursion into the house.</p>


<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>A MIDNIGHT VISIT.</h3>


<p>The boys had seized the opportunity of
the attention of their elders being
engaged elsewhere to get into mischief.
Although they had made so
much fuss about their right of way to
school, it was not the only way they used.
They had, in fact, several ways. One was
by train to Baskerton, a village on the
river five miles away, and thence, by lanes
and the parks, home. This, however, required
time and the absence of authorities. Another
way was through Easton and the parks, up
the course of the little stream, which at one
point nearly touched the Court gardens. In
this stream, its shallow waters splashing up
against their ankles, the boys were walking,
and the baby was prancing between them.</p>

<p>"Should we take Barbe with us?" David
had asked, pausing on the Green.</p>

<p>"If we can get her," Sandy had replied.</p>

<p>The boys reconnoitred, and the piercing
whistle, which set the baby all a-quiver with
expectation, sounded through the garden.</p>

<p>"There then, go!" said nurse somewhat
crossly, as Barbe began to stamp; and she
went. Her education was proceeding apace.
Her father sometimes listened aghast at the
things which, in her baby prattle, she reported
herself to have done.</p>

<p>"See, Barbe, there's a rat!" Sandy said
eagerly, as a flop and a splash made them jump.
"See, it's swimmin' away."</p>

<p>"'Wimmin' away," said the baby, stooping
to look, her two hands on her two knees, and
the front of her frock sailing on the water
before her.</p>

<p>"Oh, Barbe, you're all wet!" David said,
as they landed, and strolled up the field.</p>

<p>"Wet!" she echoed delightedly. "Foots&mdash;f'ock!"</p>

<p>"You'll have to be dried."</p>

<p>"I know," said Sandy cheerfully; "we'll
dry you by the Bishop's fire&mdash;almost sure to
be a fire."</p>

<p>But the study window, to which they crept
warily by sheltered ways, was shut. The
Bishop was absent.</p>

<p>"Now what's to be done?" said David.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know where there's a fire," Sandy said.
"Was this morning, 'cos of that lead. Let's
take her to the little room."</p>

<p>Again they slipped by leafy ways out of
the Palace garden into the cathedral yard.
The baby's wet skirts flopped round her, and
David lifted her into his arms.</p>

<p>The approach of Mrs. Lytchett, returning
from the Deanery in unwonted bravery of
attire, prompted them to seek refuge behind
a tomb. Here it took the boys' whole attention
to prevent Barbe's chatter drawing unwished-for
notice upon them.</p>

<p>"Hush! Barbe, don't call!" entreated Sandy.</p>

<p>"Barbedie good girl," announced the baby
in a loud voice, lifting herself on tip-toe to see
the passer-by.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lytchett's ears were good, and, besides,
she felt certain at this point that her eyes
had seen something fluttering. She stepped
off the pathway, and examined a tomb near.</p>

<p>"Hush!&mdash;sh&mdash;sh!" cautioned David, holding
up his finger to his mouth&mdash;a movement which
so pleased Barbe that she proceeded to copy it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lytchett passed on; the danger was
over. David lifted up the baby and carried
her into a little octagon room near by, built
in the wall of the cathedral, and used frequently
as a workroom or office.</p>

<p>Here the boys were at home. It was the
head-quarters of their greatest friends&mdash;the
masons engaged on the renovations always
in progress at the cathedral.</p>

<p>In the grate were the slowly dying embers
of a fire, and the room was empty.</p>

<p>"Mr. Galton ain't locked up yet, knowed
he wouldn't," said Sandy. "He likes his tea
punctual&mdash;'spects it's time. Now, Barbe, come
an' get done."</p>

<p>Whilst David was holding the baby to
the fire, Sandy disappeared, presently returning
with an excited face.</p>

<p>"They've nearly done," he said. "It's prime
up there. Seems to me, we'd best settle as
soon as possible."</p>

<p>"This baby won't get dry," said David,
gloomily. "Just look at her!"</p>

<p>"I know," said Sandy, regarding the
bedraggled Barbe. "We'll take it off an'
leave it here. An' I'll fetch her somefink.
Sure to be somefink stored in Margie's basket&mdash;know
Orme made holes in himself last
week."</p>

<p>So it happened that it was a little blue
girl&mdash;clad in one of Orme's shabbiest overalls&mdash;who
met Mrs. Bethune's returning chair,
and was lifted to her knee for a "yide."</p>

<p>"But what has happened? where are her own
clothes?" Mrs. Bethune asked, recognising
the substitute.</p>

<p>"We thought they were just a little
damp," said Sandy in explanation, climbing
up the back of the chair to kiss his mother.</p>

<p>"Good boy, Sandy!" said his mother, "to
take care of her."</p>

<p>"But how did they get damp?" asked
Marjorie suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Just a little water p'raps got on them,"
he replied, feeling the tone unkind after his
mother's praise.</p>

<p>"Then you have been in mischief?" asked
Marjorie.</p>

<p>"Barbedie walked in er water," the baby replied,
as if she had been doing a good work.</p>

<p>"You shouldn't have let her," Mrs. Bethune
said caressingly.</p>

<p>"Barbe don't want lettin'," answered Sandy
philosophically. "She does wivout."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The sweets of mischief whetted the boys'
appetites for more. They applied themselves
with zeal to a work they had in hand, and
for the next few days little was seen of
them.</p>

<p>One evening they were standing in a
disused corner of the Palace grounds, under
the ruined window of the old banqueting
hall, which formed part of the wall enclosing
the gardens of the modern wing of the
house. The corner where they stood was
immediately adjoining the wall of their own
garden, and was part of an overgrown
shrubbery between the ruins and the parks.</p>

<p>Both boys were exceedingly dirty. Faces,
capless heads, fingers, clothes, all bore traces
of the underground work from which they
had just emerged. They had burrowed from
their cave, and were mightily pleased at
their point of exit. No place could be more
secluded, nor less likely to be discovered.
And from the ruined wall close by, under
the shelter of a spreading elder, they were
able to drop easily either into the cathedral
yard or the Bishop's garden.</p>

<p>"Now the game begins. We've got a
base of operations," said David grandly.</p>

<p>"How much?" asked Sandy.</p>

<p>"What you work from, and what you fall
back upon, if you get besieged. And it's a
good base too," he added, looking round.
"We've got to make this passage hard and
firm, and then hide it from that prying
gardener."</p>

<p>"An' we can pay back Mrs. Lytchett," said
Sandy with joy.</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know! She just hates us going to
the Bishop's window. He told me he'd just
got a new tin of gingerbread, an' now we
can get in wivout goin' through the gate.
She's made that gate so it clicks."</p>

<p>"But you mustn't let her see."</p>

<p>"Not me! If she comes, we'll just run
round the house, and she'll fink we've
come back way. And then she'll run round
to catch us, an' we shan't be there."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>Sandy spoke with the certainty of much
experience, as, indeed, he had a right to do.</p>

<p>"Our character is all gone," David said
thoughtfully, "so it don't much matter how
bad we are."</p>

<p>"No, s'long as it ain't wicked bad.
We'll be highwaymen, but we won't
be thieves and robbers."</p>

<p>"We can get into the cathedral, too,"
suggested David.</p>

<p>And then, with minds full of revolution
and anarchy, the boys bent earnestly to
the preliminary work of making their
passage secure.</p>

<p>"Ross and Orme, you're never to go
along there without us," David said to
his young brothers, when he had wriggled
back to the cave whence his passage
started. Now their services were no
longer needed, they were felt to be
rather nuisances.</p>

<p>"If you do, you'll get smacked right
hard," said Sandy.</p>

<p>Both children fixed round eyes on their
elders, unable to understand this sudden
change. They were dismayed at its injustice.
For some days they had been
treated with indulgent kindness, all their
faults overlooked, so long as they did
diligent work. They were cleaned when
possible, and consoled when their dirty
appearance awoke wrath in the powers
responsible for them. Now, it seemed,
all was changed. There was no mistaking
Sandy's attitude, as he stood ready to administer
the smacks alluded to. Nor were
David's frowning brows more encouraging.</p>

<p>Ross tried argument. "We'se scooped,
too," he said. "We'se got dirty, ever
so," he added.</p>

<p>"Ever so," echoed Orme.</p>

<p>"No matter! You kids must do as you're
bid, and if ever you go a step along there
you'll catch it. See?" said David. And the
infants, with moody brows, averred that they
saw.</p>

<p>By this time the hole which formed the
entrance to the cave was much improved.
The wooden steps had been replaced by a
flight of mud steps, the making of which had
been a joy, not only to the boys, but to the baby.
They had required water as well as mud in
their making&mdash;endless paddlings and pattings
and treadings down of little feet before the
staircase was complete. David had engineered
the proceedings, and Mr. Warde, now and
then hovering about the top, had conferred
advice. He was not encouraged to descend.
The boys wanted no prying grown-ups to
mar their schemes. Marjorie, now and then,
had suspicions that some extra mischief was
afloat. Never before had she known them
to stick to anything for so long. But she
recollected the fascination of caves and holes,
and was, besides, much engaged with her own
concerns.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/img178.jpg" width="250" height="354" alt="bishop" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">The Bishop and the boy.&mdash;<em>p. 170.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>One evening the Bishop, on leaving the
drawing-room, had gone to his study. It
had been a wet day, and the rain had finished
in a thunderstorm an hour or so before,
leaving the sky washed and pellucid
under the summer moon.</p>

<p>The shutters had been closed and a little
fire lighted; but presently, finding the room
warm, the Bishop opened the window, and
stood gazing over the wide lawn which
occupied the space between the house and
the ruins.</p>

<p>The delicate tracery of the ruined window of
the banqueting hall, and the many unevennesses
of the walls, stood out black against the
sky. Every object on the lawn&mdash;every bush
and tree and flower&mdash;was sharply distinct.</p>

<p>As he looked, his eye caught a movement
among the distant shrubs. Some small object
was advancing along the gravelled walk surrounding
the lawn. Presently, as if attracted
by the light, it turned off the pathway on
to the lawn, in a bee-line for the window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>The Bishop stood watching, wondering a
little, when the object resolved itself first into
a small boy, and then into Sandy Bethune.</p>

<p>"Why, Sandy!" he exclaimed, "how did
you get here?"</p>

<p>"Is it the middle of the night?" asked
Sandy in his usual cheerful way.</p>

<p>"Nearly. It's half-past eleven. Good
gracious! What have you been doing?"</p>

<p>For, on approaching the light, Sandy was
seen to be covered with mud and otherwise
much disarrayed.</p>

<p>Sandy considered. He was in a deep fix&mdash;so
deep a one as to threaten the upheaval
and overthrow of some well-laid plans, just
on the point of being carried out. The
Bishop was an understanding man. Sandy
had confided in him before, and knew his
worth. If only Mrs. Lytchett did not live at
the Palace, and spoil everything, Sandy would
have been quite willing to share that residence
with the Bishop. He had once told the Bishop
so, artlessly asking when Mrs. Lytchett was
going away to live elsewhere. The Bishop, on
his side, found the children of his friend very
charming, specially so irrepressible Sandy;
and was ready to be lenient when their peccadilloes
were in question. He now invited
Sandy in, despite the muddy covering which
encased him from head to foot. Sitting down,
he began to question him gravely.</p>

<p>"What is it, Sandy? Why are you in
such a mess?"</p>

<p>Sandy sat down on a little stool, as if
glad to present his small person to the fire,
and said, "It's the bovering funderstorm.
We'd never thought of that. An' we got
caught, an' had to take shelter, an' when
we got back our way was bunged up&mdash;all
squashy with mud. An' we hadn't got no
spades nor fings out with us. So at last I
said I would go and scout&mdash;you know&mdash;an'
then I saw you."</p>

<p>"Who's 'we'?" asked the Bishop.</p>

<p>"Me an' David."</p>

<p>"And how did you get into my garden?"</p>

<p>"Oh, over the wall. We're highwaymen,
and we've got a way of our own."</p>

<p>"Indeed. And where's David now?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he's over there, all muddy, tryin'
to clean himself. He's a deal worse than
me," said Sandy cheerfully.</p>

<p>"He must indeed be bad, then. What do
you propose to do?"</p>

<p>"That's it. We can't get back to the
pantry window now our way's gone," said
artless Sandy. "Not in at all, not wivout
knockin' at the door. I did think p'raps"&mdash;persuasively&mdash;"you
cud come and knock."</p>

<p>"I see. And then?"</p>

<p>"Then, when you was talkin' to father,
we cud slip in. Don't fink father would
see&mdash;not to notice."</p>

<p>"How long have you been highwaymen?"
the Bishop asked.</p>

<p>"On'y about a week&mdash;and this is a sickener,"
said Sandy disgustedly. "We was
ghosts for a bit at first&mdash;till a woman
screeched so we nearly got caught, stupid
fing!"</p>

<p>And the Bishop, remembering certain reports
that had been made to him, was
pleased with his acumen in refusing to call
in the police.</p>

<p>"If I were you, I should try a better
line of business," he said. "Ghosts frighten
silly women, and highwaymen are not very
creditable, on the whole."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Sandy. "We're goin' to.
Next we're goin' to be pioneers and settlers."</p>

<p>"Ah, I see. And where are you going to
settle?"</p>

<p>Sandy's bright eyes were turned suspiciously
to the kind ones looking down upon him.
He fidgeted uneasily, and a smile came
across the Bishop's face.</p>

<p>"I see," he said. "Perhaps you have not
yet made up your minds."</p>

<p>Sandy looked uncomfortable. "Not 'zactly,"
he confessed. "Truth is, it depends&mdash;I don't
fink Dave would like me to tell. It's such
a grand plan," he went on enthusiastically,
"it 'ud be such a pity&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To have it spoilt. Well, don't get into
more mischief than you can help," the Bishop
cautioned, "and don't do anything to make
your mother uneasy."</p>

<p>"Mother? Oh, mother'll laugh&mdash;she always
does. You see, the bother is," confided
Sandy, "there ain't no places to pioneer&mdash;every
bit's taken. An' we've on'y just
thought on it; an' it's splendid. We want a
girl badly, though. Margie? No, Margie's no
good. Settlers has wives an' squaws," went
on Sandy pensively, "and we've on'y got
Barbe lately, an' she's aw'fly little. 'Sides,
you have to take such care on her&mdash;she's
the on'y one Mr. Pelham's got. There's a
lot of us, but mother says she cudn't
spare not the littlest bit of one. So much
less him his one, an' such a little one. It's
a 'sponsibility," sighed Sandy, "when you
want to do fings."</p>

<p>Through the open window came the musical
sound of the chimes from the cathedral.
The Bishop, with a quick sigh, rose.</p>

<p>"There is a quarter to twelve. Your
father will be going to bed. Fetch David
quickly."</p>

<p>"Should fink he's cleaned by now," said
Sandy hopefully. "He was rubbin' himself
wiv the leaves off the trees&mdash;drippin' wet."</p>

<p>Mr. Bethune opened his front door in
response to a low knocking, which at first
he did not hear. His eyes had the unseeing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
far-away look in them of a man disturbed
in a possessing line of thought. The red
light in the hall shone on the face of the
Bishop, who entered and stood on the doormat
for a minute, in such a position as to
shield the entrance of the two muddy boys.</p>

<p>"Here is the <cite>Guardian</cite> for you," he said,
"with a very appreciative notice of your
paper." Then he went on, "And tell Marjorie
to-morrow morning not to be too cross with
the state of the boys' clothes. They've been
in mischief, but it won't happen again&mdash;not
the same sort."</p>

</div>

<p>The two men looked at one another and
laughed, and the father pretended not to
hear the scuffling of small feet upon the
stairs. The Bishop
went home with no
weight on his conscience&mdash;only
a little
pathetic envy of the
man he had just
left. Somehow
those stifled scufflings
up the stairs
had gone straight
to the depths of
his very tender and
lonely heart.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"The Bishop
knows all 'bout it,"
excused Sandy
sturdily, when confronted
by Marjorie
the next morning.</p>

<p>"The Bishop
knows that all
your clothes are in
the bath, with both
taps running!"</p>

<p>"Well, he does,"
Sandy repeated,
"proberly. He said
we were the out-an'-outest
dirtiest
little grubs he'd
ever seen."</p>

<p>"That you are&mdash;no
one will contradict
him. But he
couldn't know that
your clothes were
in the bath."</p>

<p>"Yes, he would.
If they were so
dirty, where else
could they be? It's
all that 'gustin'
funderstorm."</p>

<p>"Thunderstorm!"
echoed Marjorie
suspiciously. "That
was at ten o'clock. What has that got to
do with your clothes and the Bishop?"</p>

<p>"Tell you it has. You'd best ask him, if
you don't b'lieve me," said Sandy, hurt at her
unbelief. "Anyhow, he does know that they
was dirty. An' just cos we want to save
trouble an' wash 'em ourselves, you're cross
an' spiteful. Girls are no good&mdash;'cept little uns.
What's there to put on? Best be somefink
old, cos there's a deal of diggin' to be done."</p>

<p>"I shall stop that digging if you make
such a mess of yourselves."</p>

<p>"You'd best not," said David meaningly,
from his bed in the further corner. "If you
do, you'll be sorry," he said darkly.</p>

<h2>Three Songs of Birth</h2>

<h3>A <em>Christmas Sermon</em></h3>

<p class="center">By the Rev. Hugh Miller, M.A.</p>

<p class="hanging">
"Suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, Glory to God in<br />
the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men."&mdash;<span class="smcap">St. Luke</span> ii. 13, 14.<br />
</p>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/img181b.jpg" alt="T" width="100" height="86" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_1">Three times
are we
told in
Scripture
that the
angels sang.
At the birth
of the world,
when the
foundations
of the earth
were laid, the
morning stars sang together and all the
sons of God shouted for joy. When
Jesus was born into the world a multitude
of the heavenly host praised God
and said, "Glory to God in the highest,
and on earth peace, good will toward
men." And when anyone is born again
there is joy among the angels in heaven
over the sinner that repenteth. The subject
of the song in each case is the same:
the leading <em>motif</em> of them all is man.</p>
</div>

<p>Man, to begin with, was God's chief
end in creation, and the angels sang not
so much because a new world had been
made, but rather because a new being
akin to themselves was put into it, to
whom they might minister and with
whom they might co-operate in the doing
of God's most holy will; and this season
comes to remind us of our inherent dignity
in God's sight, of the noble ideal He has
formed for us, of the value He sets on
those whom He sent His Son to seek and
to save. As God made us and as He
intends us to be, we are not a little higher
only than the animals, we are rather
only "a little lower than the angels." He
has crowned us with glory and honour
and set us over the work of His hands.
He has put all things under our feet.
The material universe was made for man,
to be his home, to develop his powers, to
be a test and discipline of his moral
character. I refuse to be reduced to the
same rank, or to be placed in the same
order, as the beasts that perish. Remembering
the angels' first song, I assert
my supremacy.</p>

<p>And man is most of all supreme because
God has given him the freedom to choose
the objects of his life, and the means by
which he can secure them. Sun, moon
and stars are bound by laws which they
cannot transgress. The movements of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
animals are guided by impulses and instincts
over which they have no moral
control. To man alone belongs the power
of refusing to bow before God's greatness
and of disobeying God's commands. Man
only has this sovereignty; but his sovereignty
led to his servitude, and the
chains that bound him were forged by
an angel who fell before man's fall.</p>

<p>If, then, all the angels worshipped and
adored when man was made with the
great gift of free choice, how must the
holy ones that remained after the first
and great apostasy have grieved when
the fallen angels took man along with
them in their fall! For because of man's
disobedience God's idea in making man
seemed to be thwarted and the peace
and good will to which he was called
appeared no longer possible. Instead of
being the master of creation, he was
now to a large extent its unhappy victim.</p>

<p>We know from hints thrown out here
and there in Scripture with what absorbing
interest the angels followed the plans
of God to bring order once more out of
the chaos caused by sin, and the effort
He put forth to create a new heaven
and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.
No wonder, then, that when
the fulness of the time was come, and
God sent His Son, made of a woman,
made under the law to redeem man,
the angels should have sung a second
time, and anticipated for man at last
a happy time of peace and good will.</p>

<p>The angels had a clear perception of
the purpose of Christ's coming. One of
the chief of them said to Joseph, "Thou
shalt call His name <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>: for He shall
save His people from their sins." And
they all sang when He came, because
they knew that God was now dealing
in a special and most effective
way with that dark thing which cast
its shadow on heaven as well as on
earth. And it becomes us to remember
that it is the sin of man which in
the mind of God and His holy angels is
associated with the coming of Jesus
Christ. To this end was He born, and
for this cause came He into the world.</p>

<p>The sin of our first parents had passed
on from generation to generation, and
each one of the millions of mankind had
to say, "Behold, I was shapen in iniquity;
and in sin did my mother conceive me";
and each fulfilled in his own life all too
truly the sad promise of his birth. How
was the tradition to be broken, and yet
broken by one who really belonged to
the race? The instincts of man himself
foreshadowed the truth. Stories of a
virgin birth here and there discernible in
paganism show the deep intuition which
was realised in Jesus Christ. He came
into the world to fight with sin, to redeem
a race steeped in a terrible heritage
of evil, and that He might redeem it
He Himself was born, and yet was free
from evil.</p>

<p>He fought sin and He conquered it.
Why, then, has the angels' song not been
fulfilled? Why does sin still cast its
shadow on earth and heaven alike? Why
does God's loving purpose in sending His
Son seem still to suffer so wide defeat?
Because in his recovery as in his fall,
man's will must play its part. I can only
be saved from sin when I <em>will</em> to be saved;
I only become a partaker of the benefits
which Christ brought from heaven to
earth when, yielding to the inspiration
of the Holy Spirit, I turn with full
accord to Jesus Christ as my Saviour.
Marvel not, therefore, that we say to you
with peculiar emphasis on the day in
which Christ was born, "Ye must be born
again." Otherwise, His birth is of no avail
to you and me. We are not honouring
Him, we are putting Him rather to an
open shame, if we keep out of our thoughts
at this time the supreme purpose of His
coming, if we are not personally dealing
with Him even now as to the burden
and guilt of our sin.</p>

<p>But we can set the angels a-singing in
the sky, and the melody of their music
can be felt in our own hearts, if we
turn in lowly penitence to Him who
came to save His people from their sins,
and to quicken them to a new life of
righteousness and peace and joy. Only
when a man comes to himself in lowly
penitence, and then goes to his Father
with a lofty faith, does he enter into the
full purpose of his manhood; and only
then, also, is there not only joy among
the angels in heaven over the sinner
that thus repenteth, but there is music
and dancing on the earth as well, and
the old life ends in which sin reigned,
and the new begins in which Christ
reigns; and His reign means "Glory to
God in the highest, and on earth peace,
good will to men."</p>

<p>"There is no peace, saith my God, to
the wicked."</p>

<h2>THE HOUSE COMFORTABLE.</h2>

<p class="center">By Lina Orman Cooper, Author of "The House Beautiful," Etc.</p>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/img184b.jpg" alt="T" width="100" height="112" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_1">The House Beautiful must
needs be also the
House Comfortable, if
we take true loveliness
to consist of perfect
fitness for service.
Thoroughness is the
keynote of each. In
order to strike it we
must have entered heart and soul into
Ruskin's translation of St. Ursula's
Room. Carpaccio himself painted the
useful in the beautiful in this famous
picture. From the princess's book, set
up at a slope fittest for reading, to
the shelf which runs under the window,
providing a place to put things on&mdash;from
a silver lamp on the white wall
to the little blue slippers beside her
bed, each detail ensures comfort of the
first quality.</p>
</div>

<p>Comfort is a thing quite apart from
fashion. So it is easier to indicate the
road which leads to the House Comfortable
than it was to point out details
in the House Beautiful. We most of us
agree about the essentials required for
real comfort: chairs upon which you
can sit fearlessly; beds which rest and
do not bruise; arms that support without
cramping; pokers that bend not;
strong tables and sharp knives, these
are a sample of the things I mean. But
true comfort depends on more than
surface surroundings. It is indissolubly
linked with attention to detail. The
houses to which guests return time
after time is the one in which soap is
never absent from its tray, and where
pillows are not only covered with
frilled slips, but also stuffed with down
and interlined with soft covering in
place of waxed ticking.</p>

<p>I would say, first of all, that the House
Comfortable must stand in a sunny situation.
This ensures warmth and light,
without which our bodies are ill-nourished
and miserable. "Where the
sun never comes the doctor does" is a
much-to-be-quoted proverb. We cannot all
live exactly where we like. Circumstances
of business, and means, generally determine
locality. But common-sense must
guide us in the selection of our houses. If
we would be really comfortable, we must
live in light, dry, airy, and clean homes.
Never take a house on the sole recommendation
of its pretty appearance. To
have a really beautiful house we must
first see that it is essentially built for
comfort. The really useful and good is
generally ornamental, for it possesses the
realistic beauty of <em>fitness</em>. A north and
south aspect for the chief sitting rooms,
with east and west windows, secures both
sunshine and shade. We want afternoon
coolness as well as morning light. If our
apartment looks towards the sun rising,
heavy curtains should be ready to draw
when east wind rages. A stick to effect
this noiselessly is a small boon much
appreciated. If our casement faces the
golden gates of the west, no such protection
is called for. But all windows
should have double blinds&mdash;white outside,
to absorb heat, and dark inside, to veil
the sun when necessary. The comfort of
lying in bed, facing a dark green blind
can only be estimated by those who have
reluctantly been disturbed by the too
early shafts of the god Ph&oelig;bus.</p>

<p>There should be a triple water supply in
the House Comfortable; ewers always
filled from the soft-water pump. Every
well and tank should be tested ere we
take up residence. Pure water, and
plenty of it, is essential to the health (and
therefore comfort) of every household.
It should be perfectly clear and bright,
and free from taste or smell. Yet impurity
may lurk even in the most sparkling
water. Therefore science must decide
as to its desirability. If only iron or
lime water is procurable, jars of lump
ammonia, or a bottle of cloudy liquid
ammonia, a bag of oatmeal or a bundle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
of bran should lie on every washstand.
The hot-water boiler not only supplies
unlimited baths, but may be devised to
heat the house. In every Canadian home
a stove in the cellar warms the rooms
above by means of drums and fans. We
might do much the same in England with
our hot-water pipes. These should
certainly run through the linen-press and
clothes cupboards, and terminate in bathroom
spirals. On these, towels and rough
sheets could be dried and aired. A face
cloth always warm is one of the luxuries
in our House Comfortable.</p>

<p>After sanitation, ventilation takes its
place in the home. How to secure a constant
supply of fresh air is a question
which demands most serious consideration.
In ages past, houses were unintentionally
ventilated by the ill-fitting
doors and window-frames, wide chimneys,
and open fire-places. But in our modern
buildings comfort is secured by almost
air-tight doors and windows. Ventilators
at the top of such are delightful and
necessary for real comfort, or a Queen
Anne casement may have a swing in its
upper frame. It is not always easy, however,
to secure exemption from draught
in our modern mansions. When the
brick-and-mortar fiend has placed door,
window, and fireplace exactly opposite
each other, screens must be judiciously
used. A brass rod from which hangs a
curtain, screwed into the door jamb and
suspended by a tiny chain from the ceiling,
is a good thing, or an ordinary <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">portière</i>
may be allowed. The former plan, however,
enables us to keep the door open
without feeling a wind.</p>

<p>Padded stair-carpets secure noiseless
ascent in the House Comfortable. Cork
mats by the big bath are welcome to bare
feet. Many cupboards are a necessity.
A place for everything and everything
in its place is one of the initial rules for
everyone's comfort. It is also Divine
law. Hanging presses, medicine cupboards,
butler's pantry, housemaid's
closets, keep dresses from dust, poisons
from the unwary, silver and glass
intact, and brushes unworn.</p>

<p>The House Comfortable must not be
over-servanted. Neither must it be
undermanned. Of the two evils, the
latter is preferable, as the mistress herself
then looks after the minutiæ of her
house. With all deference to Matthew
Prior, comfort does not flow on a line
with ignorance. It requires a cultivated
intelligence to provide such in our homes.</p>

<p>Education has done much for us on
this point. How not to do it in the
House Comfortable is exemplified by the
abodes of our forefathers. Going over
Beaumaris Castle the other day, I noted
the small apertures for exit; the high
caverns of chimneys; the windows of
horn; the crooked stairs. Nowadays we
find stoves and slow combustion grates
quite a necessity for comfort&mdash;whilst
lofty ceilings, broad staircases, and wide
windows can be quite as picturesque,
and are far more to be desired.</p>

<p>The dictionary definition of the word
"comfort" implies enlivenment and capability
for dispensing bodily ease. For
this, moral qualities are as necessary as
well-planned, well-equipped houses.</p>

<p>Punctuality, for instance, is an ingredient
required to secure a comfortable
home.</p>

<p>When breakfast and dinner are movable
feasts, served up at the whim of a
lie-a-bed or a gad-about, they can only be
make-believes, after all. Cold coffee is
unpalatable even when partaken of in a
sunny room. Whitey-brown sausages are
unappetising unless piping from the pot.
Yet this&mdash;like all other virtues&mdash;may be
strained too far. Nothing is more uncomfortable
than to feel no latitude is
allowed to a weary guest, or to find one's
host at marmalade three minutes after
the time appointed for the disappearance
of a savoury. Courtesy in this must be
our rule. Neatness is another necessity.
No house can be really comfortable that
is littered with papers, or in which boots
lie in the drawing-room&mdash;yet finickiness
in arrangement makes the home unbearable.
The most uncomfortable visit I
ever paid was to the most scientifically
correct house. Chairs were not allowed
to touch the wall-paper; footstools
never shifted. A towel for wiping down
the varnish of the bath was provided,
and&mdash;I was made miserable! By all means
keep paint and paper in as much primitive
purity as possible, but let unobtrusive
service guard these points.</p>

<p>Much more could I discourse of the
House Comfortable, but space forbids.
Let me only remind you that the veriest
cottage&mdash;plenished with wisdom and
lovingly provided&mdash;may fulfil all its conditions
just as well as the most luxurious
castle.</p>

<h2>DONKEY BOY <span class="smcap">To The</span> QUEEN</h2>

<h3><em>A TRUE INCIDENT.</em></h3>

<p class="center">By Alfred T. Story</p>

<h4>Part II.</h4>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/img186b.jpg" alt="I" width="100" height="99" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_1">A week passed before anything
further was heard.
Then a summons came
for Tam to appear before
her Majesty on the
following afternoon. He
was duly in attendance,
and had not long to
wait before a man in Highland costume
came into the room where he was seated
and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Noo, my braw laddie, her Most Gracious
Majesty and his Royal Highness the
Prince Consort will come in through
that door in twa seconds. When they
enter all you hae to dy is ta stan' up
an' mak' yer obeisance. An' when they
ax ye a question jist ye say yes or nae,
your Majesty, or your Royal Highness,
as the case may be. An' if they ax ye
naething&mdash;weel, jist ye say naething in
return."</p>
</div>

<p>With these words the wise servitor
withdrew. Barely had he gone out of
one door ere the other opened, and the
same lady he had seen before, leaning
on the arm of the gentleman he likewise
remembered, appeared before friend Tam.
They were both dressed much more
richly than when he had previously seen
them, the lady having a brilliant star
on her breast, and the gentleman wearing
a silken sash over his shoulder.</p>

<p>For a moment the boy was confused,
but he recovered himself sufficiently to
recollect that he had to make an
"obeisance." He had omitted to ask
the Highland gentleman what that was,
but he thought it must be something
like the soldier's salute, and so he stood
perfectly upright and saluted.</p>

<p>"So you have come, my lad, to see her
Majesty about the position of donkey-boy?"
said the gentleman.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;your Royal Highness," replied
Tam. Only when he had got out
the word "sir" did it flash upon him
that he was standing before the Queen
and her Royal Consort.</p>

<p>"Well, her Majesty has caused inquiries
to be made about you, and she finds
that, although you are a little wayward
and sometimes disobedient to your grandparents,
you are not on the whole a bad
boy."</p>

<p>"No, your Royal Highness," said Tam.</p>

<p>"Does that mean that you are not a
bad boy, or that you do not sometimes
disobey your grandparents?"</p>

<p>This question, though backed by a
genial smile, somewhat disconcerted the
would-be donkey-boy. He was silent
for a moment, then he answered, looking
first at one and then at the other,
with that straight glance of his, "I
hae sometimes been disobedient to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
grandparents, but I think I have learned
better now."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear that," said the
Prince.</p>

<p>Then, speaking for the first time, the
Queen said, "Well, Tam, if I make you
my donkey-boy, will you promise to be
obedient to all my slightest wishes and
commands? Do not answer lightly. I am
a severe mistress in that I expect the
strictest obedience and attention to
duty. But I, in return, am strict in
doing my duty to those I employ."</p>

<p>"And if you prove a worthy and
trustworthy servant," added the Prince,
"your position is secure for life."</p>

<p>"Not, however, as a mere donkey-boy all
your days," put in the Queen with a smile.</p>

<p>Said Tam with a faltering tongue: "If
ye'll try me, your Majesty, I'll do my
best, and," he added, as though struck
with a sudden thought, "I'll no need
to lick the donkeys, 'cos I ken hoo ta
mek 'em run 'thout the stick."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Yetta threw up her hands in amaze.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"And how do you do that?" asked the
Prince with a smile.</p>

<p>"I meks 'em carry a bunch o' thistles
afore 'em."</p>

<p>"Well, we will see," replied her Majesty,
smiling. "Now you may run home and
tell your grandparents you are to be ready
to begin duty this day week. But before
you go you will see the gentleman who
spoke to you a minute or two ago."</p>

<p>With these words and a kindly smile
the Sovereign and her Royal Consort
withdrew.</p>

<p>The one door closed, the other immediately
opened, and again entered the
Highland gentleman. "Sae ye hae been
engagit ta look after ta cuddies, eh?" he
questioned.</p>

<p>Tam said he had.</p>

<p>"Aweel, it's a verra guid step in life
for a young callant to begin wi', an' if ye
tek heed there's nae telling whereto it
may lead&mdash;ablins even to the primiership,
if ye ken what that is. For ye mun know,
the gift o' the heaven-made Prime Minister
is just to ken hoo ta manage a' th' human
cuddies that are sent to Parliament to
bother 'em. But mebbe a' that's a wee bit
abune yer understanding as yet, and sae
we'll just leave it an' speer aboot yer
claes."</p>

<p>Needless to say how surprised Donal
and Yetta were to hear Tam's story, how
thankful to reflect that their boy
was to have such a start in life.
He reported to them what had
been said, and the promise he
had given, and they believed that,
like the Jamison he was, he would
be true to his word. All the same,
they did not omit to pray for that
guidance and support for him
without which his own efforts
would be vain.</p>

<p>The evening before Tam's week
was up a parcel was delivered at
Jamison's door, addressed to his
grandson. It contained a complete
new suit, as the Highland
gentleman had said, "from the
skin outwards." Never was seen
such a brave outfit, to Tam's
thinking. He turned it over and
admired it, article by article, for
at least a couple of hours, but
would not try it on, or any part
of it, until he had had a good
wash. The tub was never a thing
he was shy of, but on this occasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
it was used as though he intended to
wash out his every fault, as well as all
the merely superficial smuts and stains
that had accumulated, so as to appear
before his Queen a spotlessly clean cuddy-tender.</p>

<p>When the operation was completed, Tam
indued himself in his new garments and
went on parade, so to speak, before his
grandmother. Yetta was busy stirring
the matutinal porridge when he walked
into the ben and said:</p>

<p>"How do I look, granny?"</p>

<p>Yetta, turning round, threw up her
hands in amaze. She hardly knew him, so
great was the transformation effected
by the new clothes and the scrubbing he
had given himself. Donal was no less
surprised when he came in from his
morning milking. Tam looked two inches
taller and a lot sprucer.</p>

<p>"Ye mind me of yer puir father," said
the old man as he sat down to breakfast.</p>

<p>That was a note of sad recollection which
brought tears to Yetta's eyes; but a smile
was soon gleaming through them when
Tam, getting sight of Meg, who was
eyeing him as it were askance, said
drily, "Meg looks as if she hardly kenned
what ta mek of her handiwark; for the
beginning o't was a' her doing."</p>

<p>Just then the noise of wheels was heard
on the road, and as the messenger who
brought the clothes left word that one of
the Queen's carriages would pick him up
on the morrow, Tam thought surely this
was the one. But it was not. Indeed, he
ran to the door at least twenty times ere,
towards eleven o'clock, his vehicle arrived.
It was a quaint affair, half carriage, half
wash-basket, drawn by two asses, creatures
as beautiful of their kind as could
be found. It was driven by her whom
he knew, and by her side were several
bright little faces, while the Highland
gentleman, riding behind on one pony,
as sturdy and Hielan' as himself, led
another by the bridle.</p>

<p>Donal and Yetta came out and with
bowed heads thanked the august though
simple-hearted lady for the great kindness
she had shown to their boy. She
replied with a kindly smile:</p>

<p>"There appears to be the making of a
good man in him, and, with God's help,
we will do our best to make him one."</p>

<p>Little more was said, and, mounting
the led pony, Tam rode off by the side
of the faithful retainer, who never got
further away from the carriage than the
dust raised by its wheels.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus commenced Tam's career in life.
Though he served the noblest lady in the
land, he did not find his way one altogether
of buttered parsnips and cream.
The one thing abhorrent to his royal
mistress was idleness and indifference.
The motto of her establishment&mdash;of all her
establishments&mdash;was "The diligent eye."
In this principle she found not only the
best interests of her own house, but the
best interests also of those who served her.</p>

<p>Tam could not be called idle, nor could
he be called exactly indifferent; but
during the years of his tending of cattle
and sheep on the brae-side he had got
into the habit of liking to loll about, to
saunter and dream, and then to make
up, or try to make up, the leeway of
work or duty by a spurt of energy.
Another fault he had was to leave things
about&mdash;for others to "side" or put in order.
This arose, no doubt, from the narrow
dimensions of his home, where there was
hardly room for everything to have its
particular place. It was, however, neither
a very grievous nor a deeply rooted
fault; and a little sharp drilling, not
unfrequently at the hands of the Highland
gentleman&mdash;a sort of major of the
household, who possessed "the diligent
eye" <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i>&mdash;soon corrected Tam's
delinquency in this regard.</p>

<p>But the other fault was more deeply
rooted and cost the young donkey-boy
many a bad quarter of an hour. Indeed,
on one occasion it nearly cost him his
place. He had been given a task to do,
and in place of doing it with all diligence
he had been found with his feet growing
to the ground, as it were. The consequence
was an interview with the Highland
gentleman, who told him, "Tam, ye have
either ta pe punisht or to leave her
Majesty's service: which shall it pe?"</p>

<p>"I'll tek the punishment, sir, if you
please," he answered.</p>

<p>"Tam, ye are a wise poy, an' we'll
mebby mek a man o' ye yet," said the
major-domo.</p>

<p>Tam took his punishment, and was the
better for it; but he still failed to come
up to his royal mistress's ideal of a
servant. Like his fellow-servitors, he had
plenty of time for rest and recreation:
hours of labour were by no means long.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
So much time had he, indeed, for himself,
that the Highland gentleman put suitable
books before him, and counselled him to
improve his mind by reading and study.
He failed, however, to profit by the advice,
and was presently made aware of
his error by a violent thunder-clap.</p>

<p>He was in attendance on his royal
mistress one day, when she and the
children were out for a drive. A poor
body was met, in apparent distress, by
the wayside. Inquiry was made as to
her condition, present help was extended,
and a promise of future beneficence given
if further investigation should warrant
its bestowal. Hence the necessity arose
for an address to be written down, and
Tam, who was that day the only person
in attendance, was requested to do it.</p>

<p>When Tam entered the royal service
he could read a bit and write very imperfectly;
but there had been time, had
he followed the counsel given him, to
have greatly improved himself in both
those accomplishments. Not having done
so, he fumbled egregiously over the task
set him, and, in short, made such a hash
of it that an eye of wrath was turned
upon him.</p>

<p>Tam had seen that eye in all its moods&mdash;of
laughter and smiles, of grief, of earnestness,
of affection, even of solemnity and
awe, but he had never as yet beheld it
flash in indignant wrath. He felt as
though the muscles of his knees had been
cut away and the ground was sinking
from under his feet. What would he not
have given to be miles away! But he had
to face the storm, and it came in this
way:</p>

<p>"Were not books and paper and ink put
before you? And were you not advised
to improve your reading and writing?"</p>

<p>Tam falteringly admitted that such
was the case.</p>

<p>"Why did you not attend to the
advice?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;" stammered the ease-loving
Tam.</p>

<p>"Had you not the time?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then why did you not do as you
were wished?"</p>

<p>Tam hung his head in shame.</p>

<p>"Tam Jamison, listen to me. I will
have those in my employ attend to
my wishes, and attend to them with
all their might. Do you wish to be
ignorant all your life, when the time
and the means for improvement are
placed at your command? In three
months' time I shall expect you to
read and write in such a way that
you will be able to fulfil in a creditable
manner a simple duty like that you
have to-day so grievously failed in. Now
we'll go on."</p>

<p>Tam Jamison wanted no more speaking
to. He was now thoroughly awake: and
he went to work with all his might to do
the behest of his mistress and Sovereign,
and, in truth, he made prodigious
progress; so that when it happened
one day&mdash;he being then in attendance
on her Majesty in another part of the
country&mdash;that she required the names
of several rare plants to be written
down for her future use, he did it so
cleverly that he was rewarded with a
pleased smile.</p>

<p>Tam felt that he had acquired wings
that afternoon, and the strangest part
of the affair was, that when he came to
reckon up precisely, he discovered that
it was three months to a day since his
"royal earwigging," as the Highland
gentleman called it.</p>

<p>To that worthy man Jamison communicated
his delight. "Ah," said he,
"ye thocht, like many anither, that ye
were doing a great service to her
gracious Majesty by your few hours of
daily labour; but, guid faith, she does a
mighty deal mair for ye than ye, or ony
the likes o' ye, can do for her. Serve
'maist onybody else in the kintra, an'
they'll take yer service an' gie ye yer
wage, an' there's an end. But when her
Majesty teks ye intil her household she
teks ye to mek a man o' ye&mdash;if it's in
ye, ye ken. An' weel she knows hoo ta
do it&mdash;nane better. Sae ye just go on
as ye've begun, Tam Jamison, an' ye'll
mebbe no bide a feckless cuddy-callant
till ye're auld an' blind."</p>

<p>Jamison did not need to be taught his
lesson a second time. He made diligent
use of his opportunities, and improved
so much and so visibly that when he
was fifteen he was raised to the position
of page. A greater mark of appreciation
could hardly be given to one in the
royal employ; for her Majesty's pages
are amongst the most trusted of her
servants.</p>

<p>At first the humbler duties of a page
fell to his lot; but as he improved in
thoughtfulness and intelligence, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
his knowledge of the manifold and delicate
duties which fell to his care&mdash;in
which he had the aid and instruction of
one of her Majesty's oldest and most experienced
pages, a man who had been in
her service ever since she ascended the
throne&mdash;he rose higher and higher in the
royal service and the royal consideration,
until at last his services were
rarely required except on State and exceptional
occasions only.</p>

<img src="images/img190.jpg" width="450" height="364" alt="Tam" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Tam hung his head in shame.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Scarcely a week passed that he did
not recall the words of him we have
called the Highland gentleman, when he
said that the Queen did more for those in
her service than they could ever do for
her, in that she not only made men and
women of them, but treated them more
as gentlemen and ladies than as mere
domestics. There were no servants in
her employ, no matter how humble their
sphere, but she knew them by name and
had their welfare at heart; and if they
served her well, she never lost sight of
them, or forgot them&mdash;no, not even when
the grave took them into its transitional
embrace.</p>

<p>Jamison had had abundant opportunities
to note and set these things down
in his heart, but he was never so much
impressed by her Majesty's deep regard
for those who served her faithfully and
well as when, one dripping autumn day,
he was required to accompany her to
the churchyard of a rural village, halfway
betwixt London and Windsor&mdash;in
which, a day or two before, the aged
servant above referred to had been
buried&mdash;in order that she might lay
a wreath upon his grave. It bore the
words, "In grateful remembrance of a
devoted and faithful servant, V.R.," and
as she bent down to place it with her
own hand upon the grave a tear fell
upon the flowers that outshone the
brightest jewel of her crown.</p>

<h2>TEMPERANCE NOTES AND NEWS.</h2>

<p class="center">By a Leading Temperance Advocate.</p>


<h3>THE TEMPERANCE HOSPITAL.</h3>

</div>

<p>The story of
the Temperance
Hospital in
Hampstead Road
forms one of the
most interesting
chapters in temperance
history.
When the experiment
of
treating accidents
and disease
without the administration
of
alcohol was first
mooted, the idea
was assailed with
a storm of criticism
in which the
medical profession found a most active ally in
the public Press. A quarter of a century has
now elapsed since the first patient was received
in the temporary premises in Gower Street,
and although the medical staff have full permission,
under certain regulations, to administer
alcohol if deemed expedient, the last Report
states that out of a total of 13,984 in-patients,
alcohol has only been resorted to in twenty-five
cases. The percentage of recoveries compares
most favourably with the ordinary
hospitals, and the
cases include every
variety of disease
and accident. The
present head of
the medical staff is
Dr. J. J. Ridge,
who has been connected
with the
institution from
the first. For
many years it has
been the custom
of the United
Kingdom Band of
Hope Union to organise
a Christmas
collection in aid
of the Temperance
Hospital. The
amount thus realised
has reached
many thousand
pounds, and it is
hoped that this
year's collection will prove the best of the
series. The body of evidence in favour of
total abstinence which the Temperance Hospital
has accumulated certainly entitles the
institution to the cordial support of the temperance
public.</p>

</div>


<h3>COMING EVENTS.</h3>

<p>Among the fixtures worth noting may be
named the New Year's Meeting of the
United Kingdom Band of Hope Union on
Saturday, January 7th; the Annual Meeting
of the London United Temperance Council,
to be addressed by the Archbishop of Canterbury,
on February 13th, in the Queen's Hall;
a great Industrial Exhibition, promoted by
the Hackney and East Middlesex Band of
Hope Union, on April 10-13; Temperance
Sunday for London Diocese April 23rd (St.
George's Day, a grand opportunity for the
clergy to strike a national note); and, as it
is well to look ahead, a World's Temperance
Convention to be held under the auspices
of the National Temperance League in 1900.</p>


<h3>THE NEW ENGLISH DICTIONARY.</h3>

<p>It may be news to some of our readers that
Dr. James A. H. Murray, the editor-in-chief
of the monumental literary work which has
been in progress for so many years, is an
earnest total abstainer and a Vice-President of
the National Temperance League. Dictionary-making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
and total abstinence seem to run together.
In William Ball's "Slight Memorials
of Hannah
More" is this
remark: "I
dined last week
at the Bishop
of Chester's. Dr.
Johnson was
there. In the
middle of dinner
I urged Dr.
Johnson to take
a <em>little</em> wine. He
replied: 'I can't
drink a <em>little</em>,
child, therefore I
never touch it.
Abstinence is as
easy to me as
temperance
would be difficult.'" It is rather curious to
note that it is only within recent years that
our dictionaries have taken any cognisance
of the meaning which temperance people
give to the word "pledge." More than
this, in the early dictionaries the word
was almost exclusively given up to the
other side of the drink question. For instance,
in Bailey's Dictionary (1736) we have
the following definition of the word
"pledged":&mdash;"Having drank by the recommendation
of another."... "The custom of
pledging in drinking was occasioned by the
Danes, who, while they had the superiority in
England, used to stab the English or cut their
throats while they were drinking; and thereupon
they requested
of some
sitter-by to be
their pledge and
security while they
drank; so that 'I
will pledge you'
signifies 'I will be
your security that
you shall drink in
safety.'"</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/img192a.jpg" width="250" height="335" alt="dictionary" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"DICTIONARY" MURRAY.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Contrast this
with the definition
given in the last
edition of Webster's
Dictionary:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A promise or
agreement by
which one binds
one's self to do, or
to refrain from
doing something;
especially a solemn promise in writing to
refrain from using intoxicating liquors or
other liquor; as to sign the pledge."</p>

<p>No doubt, when Dr. Murray reaches the letter
"P," we shall have a definition even still more
illuminating. The New English Dictionary
viewed from a temperance standpoint would
make a delightful study. Take, for instance,
volume one, in which "Alcohol" has more
than a column to itself, while "Ale" has two
columns, "Beer" two and a half columns, and
"Abstain," "Abstainer," and "Abstaining" are
treated with a wealth of illustration and meaning
derived from such authorities as Wyclif
in 1382 down to J. W. Bardsley (the present
Bishop of Carlisle) in 1867, who is pressed
into the service in this form:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Abstaining.</span>&mdash;Practising abstinence (from
alcoholic beverages) 1867. <span class="smcap">J. W. Bardsley</span> in
'Clerical Testimony to Total Abstinence' 30:
'The bride was the daughter of an abstaining
clergyman.'"</p>

</div>

<p>Now we will leave it to our fair readers to
puzzle over until
next month as
to who the
blushing bride
was who is thus
assured of immortality
in the
greatest Dictionary
the world
has ever seen.</p>


<h3>"TWO QUEENS
OF SONG."</h3>

<p>"Example is
better than precept,"
says the
old adage, and
there can be no
doubt that the
example of Madame
Antoinette
Sterling
and Mrs. Mary Davies in the matter of total
abstinence has been of the utmost value. It
was at a reception given by Mr. and Mrs.
Frederick Sherlock at Hackney, in 1892, to
the Archbishop of Canterbury (then Bishop
of London), that Madame Sterling, to the surprise
of a delighted audience, volunteered "a
few words." The gifted singer remarked that
"she had been nearly all her life a total
abstainer. When on long tours with members
of her profession, it had been rather an
aggravation to them to see, when they were
pretty well prostrated, that she was almost
or quite as fresh at the end of the journey
as at the beginning. They also complained
of the quality of the wine furnished to them,
as well as of water. She took milk and cocoa,
and also water, of which she did not complain,
and scarcely missed one engagement in
the seventeen years during which she had been
before the public. She had never had a day's
bad health, and had not suffered from those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
aches and pains of which she had heard other
people complaining continually." Like Madame
Sterling, Mrs. Mary Davies has upon many
occasions shown a deep and practical interest
in philanthropic work.</p>

<h3>A FAMOUS BAND OF HOPE.</h3>

<p>Possibly the most
unique Band of Hope in
the world is that which
is held in the Royal
Naval School, Greenwich.
It was founded so far
back as 1871, by Samuel
Sims, an honoured agent
of the National Temperance
League, and upon
his death, in 1892, was
taken over by Mr. W. S.
Campbell, as the League's
representative. No pressure
at all is put upon
the lads to induce them
to join the Band of Hope, but, as a matter of
fact, most of the lads in the school readily do
so, and the present membership is fully a
thousand strong. Regular weekly meetings
are held, and the annual gathering, which is
held in the great gymnasium, is a most
inspiriting spectacle. A visit to the Royal
Naval School, if it should happen to be in
recreation time, cannot fail to afford considerable
satisfaction to those who like to
see Young England at play. Every type of
healthy pastime is encouraged in its turn,
and these young abstainers have frequently
shown that they are well able to hold their
own. It is encouraging to know that the
principles of total abstinence are not discarded
when the lads pass out into the
Royal Navy or Mercantile Marine, for every
year large numbers of
them are drafted into
Miss Weston's well-known
temperance society.</p>


<h3>TEMPERANCE SUNDAY.</h3>

<p>The appointment of a
special Sunday for the
preaching of sermons
on temperance originated
with the Church of England
Temperance Society
many years ago. Owing
to various circumstances,
it is not possible for the
Church of England clergy to take one Sunday
simultaneously for the whole country, but
each diocesan Bishop makes choice of a day
and issues a pastoral letter to his clergy, so
that at one period of the year or another
the whole country is covered, so far as the
Church of England is concerned. The Nonconformist
bodies have, however, for some
years past, fixed upon the last Sunday in
November for Temperance Sunday, and as we
go to press we learn that this year special
reference will be made to the importance of
Sunday Closing.</p>

<h2>SCRIPTURE LESSONS FOR SCHOOL &amp; HOME
INTERNATIONAL SERIES</h2>

<h3>With Illustrative Anecdotes and References.</h3>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">December 18th.</span>&mdash;<strong>The Captivity of Judah.</strong></p>

<p><em>To read&mdash;Jer. lii. 1-11. Golden Text&mdash;Jer. xxix. 13.</em></p>

<p>This chapter describes the fate of Judah.
Later kings were all wicked. Warnings
of Jeremiah and other prophets all been
in vain. Time has come for judgment.
Captivity in Babylon, long foretold, now about to
commence. Came about in reign of Zedekiah. The
eleven verses of this lesson almost identical with
Jer. xxxix. 1-10.</p>

<p>I. <strong>The King</strong> (1-3). <em>His name.</em> Originally Mattaniah,
was son of good King Josiah and uncle of
late King Jehoiachin. Jeremiah had prophesied of
a future king (Jer. xxiii. 5-7) as the "Lord our
righteousness." The king assumed that name, and
was called Zedekiah.</p>

<p><em>His acts.</em> "Did evil," but had not always been
altogether evil. Had made covenant with nobles
and priests to abolish slavery (xxxiv. 8-10). But
his great wrong was breaking his solemn oath of
allegiance to king of Babylon (2 Chron. xxxvi. 13).
This looked upon as his crowning vice (Ezek. xvii. 8),
for which God's anger was upon him (ver. 3).</p>

<p><strong>Lesson.</strong> When thou vowest a vow defer not to
pay it.</p>

<p>II. <strong>The Siege</strong> (4-7). City besieged for last time.
Jews never forgot day it began. Was January&mdash;tenth
day of their tenth month. Great mounds or (earth-works)
outside walls to shoot burning arrows, etc.;
houses outside thrown down (Jer. xxxiii. 4). Famine
and pestilence soon ravaged crowded population
inside.</p>

<p><em>The assault.</em> City, after eighteen months, taken
by assault at northern gate (B.C. 587). King and
his family and royal guard escaped by passage between
two walls (Jer. xxxix. 4), by royal gardens,
down steep descent towards Jericho. There he was
overtaken and made prisoner. His broken oath
caused his destruction (Ezek. xvii. 20).</p>

<p><strong>Lesson.</strong> Evil shall hunt the wicked to overtake
him.</p>

<p>III. <strong>Babylon.</strong> He was taken to Babylon. His
sons killed in his sight, then his eyes put out,
bound with chains, kept in prison till death.
Feeble in will, faithless in promise, judgment came
upon him.</p>

<p><strong>Lesson.</strong> 1. The word of the Lord standeth sure.</p>


<h4>Bargains.</h4>

<p>He who buys the truth makes a good bargain. Zedekiah
dealt in falsehood and lost his throne. Esau sold
his birthright for a basin of soup. Judas made a bad
bargain when he sold his Lord for the price of a slave.
Take heed to the thing that is right, for that alone shall
bring peace at the last.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">December 25th.</span>&mdash;<strong>A Christmas Lesson.</strong></p>

<p><em>To read&mdash;Hebrews i. 1-9. Golden Text&mdash;St. Luke ii. 11.</em></p>

<p>This letter written to the Hebrews, i.e. Christians
of Jewish birth who clung to the priesthood and
services of the Temple as well as to Christianity.
St. Paul shows how far the Christian system was
superior to and superseded the Jewish. The types
and ceremonies of the Law fulfilled in Christ,
whose birthday is kept at Christmas.</p>

<p>I. <strong>God's Revelation</strong> (1-2). <em>Past.</em> God revealed or
unveiled Himself of old. This revelation inferior
in three ways, viz. (1) It was given gradually,
in portions, a part at a time. (2) Given in divers
manners, under many figures and types. (3) Given
by prophets, only human.</p>

<p><em>Present.</em> Final revelation of God's truth&mdash;once
for all given to the saints (Jude 3). Given by His
Son&mdash;the Word of God (St. John i. 1, 2); heir of
all things&mdash;God's agent in creation of the universe.</p>

<p>II. <strong>God's Son</strong> (3-9). <em>Great in Himself.</em> Has
Divine glory&mdash;the outshining of the Father's glory.
He is God's image, the counterpart of the Father.
To see Christ is to see God (St. John xiv. 9).</p>

<p><em>Great in His work.</em> (1) <em>Upholder</em> of the universe
as well as its Creator. (2) <em>Saviour.</em> Came not
only as prophet to reveal God's will, but to
purge man's sin. This He did by Himself with
His own blood (ix. 12, 14).</p>

<p><em>Greater than angels.</em> In His person, His work.
His exaltation to glory; testified by Scripture, <em>e.g.</em>
Psalm ii. 3 tells of Christ's eternal Sonship&mdash;also
referred to by St. Paul as fulfilled in His resurrection
(Acts xiii. 33).</p>

<p><em>King over all.</em> Christ also a King. Rules in
righteousness (Psalm xlv. 6, 7); received throne
as victor over His enemies&mdash;sin, death, and the
devil (xii. 2). Raised high above all.</p>

<p><strong>Lesson.</strong> Christ is King&mdash;honour Him; He is
Saviour&mdash;love Him; He is God&mdash;fear Him. Kiss
the Son, lest He be angry, and so ye perish. Blessed
are all they that put their trust in Him.</p>


<h4>Christ in the Old and New Testaments.</h4>

<p>A weaver, who had made an elaborate piece of
tapestry, hung it upon the tenterhooks in his yard.
That night it was stolen. A piece of tapestry was
found by the police, which seemed to answer the description;
but, as the pattern was not unlike that of
other pieces, they wanted more definite proof. It was
brought to the weaver's yard, and there the perforations
in the fabric were found to correspond exactly
to the tenterhooks. This was proof positive. In like
manner, if we place the life and character of Christ
against all the prophecies of Him in Scripture, they
will be found to correspond exactly.</p>

<h4>1899.</h4>

<h5><em>New Series. The Gospel according to St. John.</em></h5>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">January 1st.</span>&mdash;<strong>Christ the True Light.</strong></p>

<p><em>To read&mdash;St. John i. 1-14. Golden Text&mdash;Ver. 4.</em></p>

<p>New Year&mdash;new course of lessons. This Gospel
records the deeper spiritual truths of Christ's
teaching, especially about His own Nature and
Person. It sets Christ forth as God. St. John
tells his object in writing a fourth Gospel in
chap. xx. 31, which the class should read.</p>

<p>I. <strong>The Nature of Christ</strong> (1-3). <em>Eternal.</em> In
the beginning, not of the world, but before all
creation, from everlasting. <em>Divine Word.</em> Christ is
the expression of the mind of God. Came to reveal
God to man (xv. 15). <em>Living Person.</em> The Word
not a mere attribute or power of God but a distinct
Person. "With God" from everlasting. Not inferior
to the Father, but very God Himself. <em>Creator.</em> As
well as Saviour and Governor of the world (read
Col. i. 16, 17; Heb. i. 2).</p>

<p>II. <strong>The Office of Christ</strong> (4-13). <em>Source of Life.</em>
As very God He had life in Himself, which He
poured forth on His creation (vv. 25, 26; xvii. 2).
<em>Source of light.</em> The life from Son of God is cause
of man's inward spiritual light by which he is saved.
<em>Himself the light.</em> World was in spiritual darkness
at Christ's coming. <em>Giver of light.</em> No man has
light in himself, however great his natural powers.
All true light is from Christ.</p>

<p><em>Rejected.</em> By His own. The world He made knew
not its Creator (1 Cor. i. 21). The nation He chose to be
His own special people (Deut. vii. 6) received Him not.</p>

<p><em>Received.</em> By a few&mdash;both Jews and Gentiles;
such as Nicodemus the ruler (iii. 1, 2), the disciples
from Galilee (ii. 11), and others. How did they
receive Him? By believing in Him. This faith,
itself the gift of God, rewarded by further privilege
of becoming God's sons&mdash;born into God's family by
a new and spiritual birth (iii. 3).</p>

<p>III. <strong>The Glory of Christ</strong> (14). Word was made
flesh by taking to Himself man's human nature.
He dwelt (<em>literally</em> "pitched His tent") with men,
full of mercy to heal bodies and souls, full of
God's truth to teach.</p>

<p><strong>Lessons.</strong> 1. <em>Hold fast the Christian faith.</em> Jesus
Christ one for ever with the Father. <em>God</em>&mdash;eternal,
glorious, Creator, Giver of light and life to the
soul&mdash;yet <em>Man</em>, like one of us.</p>

<p>2. <em>Live the Christian life.</em> Jesus is our example,
that we should follow His steps.</p>


<h4>Christians walking in the Light.</h4>

<p>A little girl in a London slum won a prize at a
flower-show. Her flower was grown in a broken teapot
in a back attic. When asked how she managed to
grow the beautiful flower, she said her success came
from always keeping the plant in the only corner of the
room ever favoured by a sunbeam. Only by walking in
the light and sight of God can Christians truly grow
and bear fruit.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">January 8th.</span>&mdash;<strong>Christ's first Disciples.</strong></p>

<p><em>To read&mdash;St. John i. 35-46. Golden Text&mdash;Ver. 36.</em></p>

<p>Christ now thirty years old; has been baptised
and received special outpouring of Holy Ghost (ver.
33), and also been tempted in the wilderness (St.
Matt. iv. 1). Is now ready for His public work
and ministry. Now begins to win disciples.</p>

<p>I. <strong>The first two Disciples</strong> (35-40). <em>Heard of
Him.</em> Picture Christ walking near the Jordan. St.
John, who had baptised Him, points Him out to
his followers. Describes Him: this the Lamb of
God to Whom all the sacrifices pointed; the innocent
lamb slain told of the death of the spotless
Son of God for man's sin. His words went home.</p>

<p><em>Followed Him.</em> Who were they? Andrew, Simon
Peter's brother, and probably St. John, writer of
the Gospel, brother of James. Why did they
follow? To learn more of Him. Had been baptised
with baptism of repentance. Sense of sin
led them to seek the Saviour. Christ knew their
thoughts, encouraged them to learn more of Him
(St. Matt. xi. 28, 29).</p>

<p>II. <strong>The third Disciple</strong> (41, 42). The two friends
separate the next day, each in search of his brother.
Andrew soon finds his&mdash;eagerly tells the news.
They have found the long-expected Messiah, the
Anointed of God. Brings Simon to Christ. No
greater proof possible of having really found Christ
than bringing another to Him. Christ looks with
eager and searching eye at Simon&mdash;reads his very
heart, sees his longing after truth; gives him a
new name, Cephas (Hebrew) or Peter (Greek),
meaning "a rock" or "stone." What did this
signify? His bold and determined character, strong
in the faith (St. Matt. xvi. 16), eager in defence
of Christ (xviii. 10), and, after his fall and
forgiveness, strong in love (xxi. 15).</p>

<p>III. <strong>The fourth Disciple</strong> (43, 44). Philip of Bethsaida.
Must have heard his friends talking of
Christ. Probably stirred in his heart. Christ found
him, as He afterwards found Zacchæus St. (Luke
xix. 5). His mission to seek as well as to save.
Happy they who obey Christ's call and follow Him.</p>

<p>IV. <strong>The fifth Disciple</strong> (45, 46). Philip soon shows
marks of discipleship. He finds Nathanael. Tells
him how Christ fulfilled prophecies, such as of a
"prophet" like unto Moses, a "king" whose name
should be "the Lord our righteousness" (Jer. xxiii.
5, 6). Nathanael asks in honest doubt if it can
be possible for the Messiah to come from despised
Nazareth. Philip did not argue, but bade him
"Come and see"&mdash;the best cure for all doubts.</p>

<p><strong>Lessons.</strong> From the Baptist: The dying Saviour
the greatest magnet for drawing souls.</p>

<p>From Andrew: Show religion first at home.</p>

<p>From Simon: Taste and see how gracious the Lord is.</p>

<p>From Philip: Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing
by the Word of God.</p>

<p>From Nathanael: Hearken unto me, and I will
teach you the fear of the Lord.</p>


<h4>"There's Another."</h4>

<p>A traveller lost in the snow on the Alps was rescued by
one of the famous dogs of St. Bernard. When restored to
consciousness his first words were, "There's another."
The monks to whom the dogs belonged continued their
search, and "the other" was found and saved. "Are you
saved?" Is there not another whom you can rescue
from sin and bring to the life of God?</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">CURIOUS ALMS-BOX IN PINHOE CHURCH.</p></div>
</div>


<h5>A Curious Alms-box.</h5>

<p>In the interesting parish church of Pinhoe, near
Exeter, appears a very curious alms-box surmounted
by the figure of a man who seems, from
his costume and general character, to date from
the period of James I. He holds two books in
his hand&mdash;representing most probably Bible and
Prayer Book&mdash;one of which bears the inscription,
"Y<sup>e</sup> Poor Man of Pinhoo, 1700," but from
information with which the vicar of the parish,
the Rev. Frederick W. Pulling, has kindly supplied
us, it appears that the books were added in
1879-80, when the church was restored. Previously
the figure held a small flimsy box in front of him.
He was, however, placed on the present handsome
oak box bearing the inscription, "Remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
y<sup>e</sup> Poor," and the old flimsy box was removed.
The present box was constructed from some very
ancient timber from the roof of Salisbury Cathedral,
when under repair. What the figure was
originally intended to represent&mdash;whether a beadle,
the dispenser of charities, or a relieving officer&mdash;is
not known. Curiously enough, the parish records
are quite silent as to the figure, and when, some
time since, it was repaired it was sent to the
eminent antiquary and ecclesiologist, the Rev.
Mackenzie Walcott, who said he had seen only
two such figures before. The wooden backing is
of Jacobean style, and was designed by the architect
in 1879 to strengthen the whole structure.</p>


<h5>"God Bless the Kernel."</h5>

<p>After the marvellous achievements in his two
Chinese campaigns, which were sufficient to have
made the reputations of a dozen ordinary colonels,
Gordon came back to England in 1865 as poor as
when he left home. During the next six years,
which he spent in Gravesend as an engineer, the
future keeper of Khartoum devoted a large portion
of his leisure to visiting the sick and to teaching
and training many of the ragged and neglected boys
of the rough neighbourhood. So truly did these
poor lads love their colonel that it was not uncommon
to see chalked up on the walls the singular
inscription, "God bless the Kernel." Their
gratitude was apparently stronger than their
orthography. When Englishmen reflect how
Gordon placed his Divine Master first in every
enterprise of his life, they must feel that no institution
intended to honour the dead hero at
Khartoum can be a worthy memorial which is
not grounded on the rock of Christianity.</p>


<h5>Christmas Cards and Gift-Books.</h5>

<p>Christmas is pre-eminently the season of universal
good-will, and the custom of conveying
seasonable greetings by means of the attractive
Christmas card is every year becoming more
general. Amongst the publishers of these mementoes
Messrs. Raphael Tuck and Sons take front
rank, and the specimen box of cards, calendars,
story-books, and illustrated texts, recently received
from them, affords ample proof that the variety
and artistic excellence which have always characterised
their productions are well maintained
this year. Some of the cards are veritable works
of art, and deserve more than the temporary
appreciation usually accorded to such; but the
palm for novelty, both in design and treatment,
must be accorded to the calendars, many of
which are most original in conception, and all
are daintily and tastefully produced.&mdash;For years
past we have been accustomed to look for a
Christmas book from Mr. Andrew Lang, and
this season he has edited an edition of "The
Arabian Nights Entertainments," which Messrs.
Longmans have published in a charming cover,
and with a number of clever illustrations by
Mr. H. J. Ford.&mdash;Another suitable gift-book for
children is "His Big Opportunity" (Hodder and
Stoughton), a brightly written story by Amy
Le Feuvre; whilst for young people what more
inspiriting and interesting work could be presented
to them than the life-story of the pioneer
missionary, "Mackay of Uganda," of whose
biography a new illustrated edition has just been
issued by the same publishers.&mdash;We have also
received the current yearly volumes of our contemporaries,
<em>Good Words</em> and <cite>The Sunday
Magazine</cite> (Isbister &amp; Co.). These would both
form valuable additions to any Sunday-school
library, and are also admirably adapted for use
as prizes or presents.</p>

<p class="center">THE LAUGHING GOD OF CHINA.</p></div>
</div>


<h5>Compensation.</h5>

<p>An Irishman being bound over to keep the
peace against all the Queen's subjects, said,
"Then Heaven help the first foreigner I meet!"
We are reminded of this when we see people
civility itself to a good servant they are afraid
of losing, or to the strongest-willed person in their
home, and then relieving their pent-up feelings
by being rude to the rest of the family.</p>


<h5>Laughter and War.</h5>

<p>"Have you any gods around here?" inquired an
English traveller in rural China. "Oh, yes," replied
a venerable Celestial; "the three Pure Ones, the
God of the Fields, and the Goddess of Mercy." "My
old friend, I am afraid your gods are not a few."
"Foreign teacher," said the old man, "verily,
verily, our gods are ten thousand and thousands of
thousands." Some are of stone, others of wood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
clay, or bronze. One may be purchased for a
farthing, another will cost £200. The Laughing
God in our illustration is a representation in coarse
pottery of Quantecong, supposed to be the first
emperor. There are laughing Buddhas for sale,
and some few images of beneficent mien; but the
great horde are intended to inspire awe or terror.
The second illustration is a well-executed terra-cotta
figure of a deified warrior. The drawn
sword and beard are similar to those of Kwante,
the God of War, regarded as the head of the
military department in China. In 1,600 state
temples dedicated to him the mandarins worship
once a month, and in thousands of smaller temples
he is honoured with sacrifices of sheep and oxen.
His worshippers believe that he was a general, who
just about the time that the Prince of Peace came
to this world in great humility made the enemies
of China to tremble. The elevation or manufacture
of gods is a simple affair. The keeper of an
idol shop collects the heads, limbs, and trunk that
he has moulded out of mud, unites them in one
ill-proportioned figure, slips a frog, snake, lizard,
or centipede into the hole in the back, and the
idol is ready for dedication and worship! The
calm, colossal Buddha at Peking is seventy feet
high, but it can only witness to a blind feeling
after God.</p>


<h5>An Ancient Manuscript of St Matthew.</h5>

<p>The romance of New Testament manuscripts
is again enlarged; this time by the discovery of
a papyrus fragment containing a part of the Gospel
according to St. Matthew. The precious sheet was
found in the Libyan desert, about one hundred and
twenty miles south of Cairo, by Messrs. Grenfell and
Hunt, the discoverers of the <em>Logia</em>. It is thought
that this fragment may be older by a hundred
years than any other manuscript of the New
Testament hitherto available. Its value, had it
been a whole book instead of two leaves, would
have been priceless. Even so, it is of singular
interest. Its actual history, of course, is beyond
discovery, but its appearance amongst the world
of scholars reminds us of the strangely varied
channels through which Greek manuscripts of the
New Testament have come down to us. There is
the romantic story of the discovery, in a monastery
on Mount Sinai, of the priceless manuscript
known as the <cite>Codex Sinaiticus</cite>. There is the
scarcely less valuable <cite>Codex Alexandrinus</cite> which
the British Museum now guards; that came to
England as a gift to King Charles I. from a
Patriarch of Constantinople. There is the great
manuscript which is one of the glories of the Vatican
Library at Rome, where it is believed to have
been ever since that library was founded. There
is the <cite>Codex Ephraemi</cite> at Paris, its ancient
writing partly legible beneath a much later work
written over it&mdash;a manuscript which once belonged
to Catherine de Medicis. There is another palimpsest
brought to England from a convent in the
Nubian desert. There is the manuscript presented
by Laud to the Bodleian, and supposed to have
been used by the Venerable Bede. In truth, the
history of these treasures is full of romance, and
it is but fitting that new discoveries should
furnish other examples of the strange ways in
which the text of the Holy Scriptures in various
parts and forms has been preserved for us.</p>

<h5>Humours of Hymen.</h5>

<p>While nothing can be so distressing to a clergyman,
whose duty it is to solemnise marriages, as
irreverence or flippancy, he can hardly fail to
be amused, if many of his people are poor and his
area is wide, at the occasional results of a genuine
ignorance, or a legitimate nervousness. A well-known
church in Central London can furnish
several singular and recent experiences. It is
not often that either of the contracting parties
comes furnished with a prayer-book, but on a
certain occasion the bride, a rather strong-minded-looking
lady, did so, and insisted on holding
it sternly and steadily under the nose of her
future spouse. In repeating the passage in which
"cherish" occurs, a bridegroom, in a faltering
voice, expressed his willingness "to love and to
'<em>perish</em>.'" "Oh, sir, I do feel <em>that</em> nervous!" once
pleaded another embarrassed swain in the middle
of the service. A widower, who was extremely
awkward and stupid in making the responses
after the minister, apologised by saying, "Really,
sir, it is so long since I was married last that I
forget"! Another bridegroom, though middle-aged,
seemed somewhat diffident with regard to his
responsibilities, and answered to the inquiry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
"Wilt thou love, comfort, honour, etc.?" "To the
best of my abilities I will." A year or two ago,
the roof of the particular church of which we are
thinking was being renovated, and the interior
was a maze of ladders. Under these a superstitious
bride earnestly begged not to be compelled
to go, so she was considerately conducted to the
chancel by a circuitous route. There was a wedding
last year at which a tiny bridesmaid made her
appearance. As he had married her parents about
six summers previously, the clergyman thought he
might venture to take her by the arm and to place
her in her proper position behind the bride. Considerably
to his surprise, the small damsel hit out
at him in a most workmanlike manner straight
from the shoulder, and the edifice resounded with a
terrific yell of defiance, "Me <em>won't</em>! Me <small>"WON'T</small>!"</p>

<h5>Some New Books.</h5>

<p>One of the most interesting biographies of the
season is that of Bishop Walsham How, which
has just been issued by Messrs. Isbister, prefaced
by an excellent portrait of the late prelate. The
Bishop was principally known by his work in the
East of London, where he was greatly loved by
clergy and parishioners alike, and many excellent
stories are related <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">apropos</i> of his cheeriness and
tolerant good nature in dealing with the mixed
elements of his crowded diocese. The memoir
seems full and complete, as, indeed, it should be,
the biographer being Mr. Frederick How (a son of
the late Bishop), who had access to all the private
memoranda of his father, and was naturally
acquainted with every incident of interest concerning
him. From the same publishers comes an
excellent work by our contributor, Dean Farrar,
on "Great Books," in which he critically reviews
the life and works of Bunyan, Shakespeare, Dante,
Milton, and other "master-spirits." Though admittedly
written for young people, the volume
contains much that is valuable and interesting to
older readers. Messrs. Isbister have also recently
issued a volume of sermons by the Rev. Stopford A.
Brooke, under the title "The Gospel of Joy."
Whilst we do not endorse all the views expressed
by the author, yet at the same time we are bound
to confess that Mr. Brooke's eloquent addresses
teem with happy and suggestive thoughts.&mdash;A
daintily produced volume reaches us from the
Scientific Press in the form of Mr. J. T. Woolrych
Perowne's account of his recent journey in Russian
Central Asia, published under the comprehensive
title "Russian Hosts and English Guests in Central<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Asia." In many respects the journey described was
quite unique, and the interest is considerably increased
by the number and variety of the excellent
illustrations which are scattered throughout the
book.&mdash;"Table-talk with Young Men" (Hodder and
Stoughton) is the title which the Rev. W. J.
Dawson gives to his recently published series of
"pen-conversations" with young men. Mr. Dawson's
practical, straightforward and cultured
"talk" on such diverse subjects as "The Art of
Living," "Christianity and Progress," "Civic
Responsibility," etc., is not only brilliant but
highly instructive, and the book is one which
should find a place on every young man's bookshelf,
for it will richly repay careful and
constant perusal.&mdash;We have also to acknowledge
the receipt of "Comfort and Counsel" (Hodder and
Stoughton), containing quotations from the writings
of Elizabeth Rundle Charles for every day in the
year; "The Children's Year-Book of Prayer and
Praise" (Longmans), compiled by C. M. Whishaw;
a useful and informing little volume on "Diet and
Food" (J. and A. Churchill), by Dr. Alexander Haig;
"A Cluster of Camphire" (Passmore and Alabaster),
containing short, sympathetic addresses by Mrs.
C. H. Spurgeon to those who are sick and sorrowful;
and "The Daily Homily" (Morgan and Scott),
a series of brief, pregnant discourses on the books
of the Bible from 1 Samuel to Job, by the Rev.
F. B. Meyer.</p>


<h5>"Out of the Eater came forth Meat."</h5>

<p>Samson's riddle is an everlasting proverb. Out
of the devouring famine that last year devastated
India blessings have already come to many provinces.
A conquered race find it hard to love and
trust their rulers, but in their trouble dwellers
in the famine districts saw the practical side of
Christianity. In the midst of universal rejoicing
England was moved with compassion, and provided
food for the starving. Government, in many instances,
entrusted missionaries with the distribution
of grain. The Indian people are slow to act and
strong to endure. Thousands perished because they
could not or would not realise that relief was
within reach. Parents gave their last morsels to
their children, and then lay down to die. Orphanages
overflowed, and new ones had to be erected.
Where an open shed and light meals of milk,
rice, and curry meet the ideas of home and housekeeping,
this is easier than it sounds. After a
famine the number of Christian adherents to
missions is always multiplied, and the supply
of pupils creates new demand for teachers. It
must be acknowledged that the taunt of being
"rice-Christians" is sometimes justified, though
there is little doubt that genuine gratitude to God,
who moved His servants to help them, has caused
numbers to turn to Him.</p>


<h5>Abraham's Vineyard.</h5>

<p>This piece of land is close to the Holy City, and
now belongs to the Society for the Relief of Persecuted
Jews. When the necessary excavation for
building was begun, Abraham's Vineyard revealed
signs of former glory and prosperity. Tesselated
pavement, vats, baths, and a columbarium hewn
out of the rock, showed that it had once belonged
to a householder with taste for luxury
as well as an eye for exquisite scenery. The
baths and vats have been converted into cisterns for
rain-water, and the place has become the scene of
industry. The earth, in past years again and
again reddened by battles, now yields peaceful
harvests of grain. All the Jewish refugees are
not, however, cultivators. Soap-making from olive
oil and alkali grown on the Jordan Plain, glue-making,
stone-dressing, quarrying, are industries
which offer many of them an honest living. The
idea of the founders of this society was "to give
relief and employment to the Jews, especially in
Jerusalem, until they are able to found colonies
on their own account." The experiment of
Abraham's Vineyard has succeeded, and the Jews
have carried the work farther, as the trade in
Jaffa oranges and olive-wood ware testify.</p>

<h2>NEW QUIVER WAIFS.</h2>

<h3>To be Selected by our Readers.</h3>


<p>For many years past our readers have generously
taken the responsibility of maintaining a
waif at Dr. Barnardo's Homes, and another at
Miss Sharman's Orphanage in Southwark; but, as
the present waifs are now growing up, and will
soon be out in the world, the time has come for
another selection. For this purpose, we have
obtained particulars of eligible cases, which we
submit to our readers, and, as we look to them
for a continuance of their kindly help in supporting
<span class="smcap">The Quiver</span> Waifs, we feel that they would
prefer to choose the new little ones who are to
be so known. We would, therefore, request our
readers to send a post-card (addressed to The
Editor of <span class="smcap">The Quiver</span>, La Belle Sauvage, London,
E.C.), stating for which waif in each of the two
sets they desire to vote, and the children with
the highest number of votes will be elected. The
post-cards should reach the Editor not later
than December 31st, 1898. It should be particularly
understood that this course will imply
no pecuniary obligation whatever on the part of
the voters, as we shall rely solely upon the voluntary
contributions of our readers to furnish the
total requisite sum for the maintenance of the
waifs, which amounts to £31 per year. All donations
will be acknowledged in <span class="smcap">The Quiver</span> month
by month.</p>
